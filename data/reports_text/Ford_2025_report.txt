ABOUT THIS REPORT Our purpose is bigger than building vehicles.
We are helping to build a better world where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.
To achieve our goals, we must build a strong, sustainable business that advances groundbreaking technology, supports people and protects our planet for generations to come.
We are committed to maintaining our leadership position in sustainability reporting with a comprehensive group of reports that outlines our activities and progress across multiple areas.
We conducted a new materiality assessment and this year’s Integrated Sustainability and Financial Report focuses on the key material topics identified in the assessment.
The report chapters are based and organized around the key material topics as we examine our business through four prisms: Products and Services, Environment, People and Governance.
In response to stakeholder feedback, the report has evolved to a more technical report that describes, with data, our clear progress toward our goals.
A supplementary Summary Report is focused on Ford’s sustainability strategy and key data points from this full Integrated Report.
This high-level summary uses storytelling and case studies to explain how we are meeting the needs of stakeholders through specific actions, products and services.
We have introduced a Sustainable Financing Report and have published a Human Rights Progress Report and a Climate Change Report.
You can also find all our indexes and ESG Overview on our website.

“ Our values have always driven this company forward.
The g reatest measure of Ford’s success is whether we are improving the lives of our customers, employees and people in the communities in which we operate.” BILL FORD, EXECUTIVE CHAIR BILL FORD JIM FARLEY T hough much about our world is changing, Ford’s purpose is the same today as it was when the first Model T was designed.
We want to help build a better world where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.
We believe that the long-term success of any business depends on how it creates value for its customers, employees, and communities, while also caring for the planet.
Our shared challenge now is bringing even greater urgency to protecting the planet, advancing social equity and supporting a just transition to electric vehicles.
In 2022, the Ford team reimagined our products, services and the way we work to align with our environmental and social priorities.
We announced that we would reorganize our global automotive operations into three distinct business segments: Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro.
As a result, we are forming deeper customer relationships, creating lifestyle-enhancing technology and pursuing exciting products.
Last year we invested in renewable energy, new facilities and upgrades to existing facilities and announced the creation of thousands of jobs.
We began the work of bringing electric vehicles to scale.
We are committed to creating a carbon-neutral transportation future.
To that end, we plan to source 100% carbon-free electricity for our global manufacturing efforts by 2035.
Last year, we made the largest renewable energy purchase from a utility in U.S. history.
Ford also issued its inaugural Sustainable Financing Report, highlighting how the net proceeds from the company’s first Green Bond are being allocated to support the design and manufacturing of Ford’s electric vehicles.
Lastly, we are supporting our suppliers, ensuring they set and meet science-based targets to reduce their carbon footprint, a critical element of our sustainability efforts that include clean air and clean water initiatives.
We are also using our purchasing power not only to fuel our business needs but also to protect our customers, communities and the environment.
We have invested resources to better understand the origins of our raw materials and ensure they are sourced responsibly.
Last year, 3BL Media’s Best Corporate Citizen ranking listed Ford first in the human rights category, and the World Benchmarking Alliance recognized us as the top automotive company in human rights for the second time in a row.
And through the work of the Ford Fund, our philanthropic arm, we continue to partner with communities to expand access to resources and opportunities that help move people forward.
Ford is undertaking a massive transformation to lead the electric vehicle revolution, and the accomplishments in this report signal our genuine commitment to doing so in a way that is consistent with our values.
Around the world, we are planning to invest more than $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 to create a carbon-neutral transportation future.
We are on track to reach an annual targeted production run rate of 600,000 electric vehicles globally by the end of 2023, and 2 million by late 2026.
Ford was the second best-selling electric vehicle brand in the U.S. in 2022.
Mustang Mach-E production continues to grow with an order bank in the thousands – two-thirds of customers are new to Ford.
F-150 Lightning has been America’s best-selling electric truck1 since its launch and the E-Transit led the electric van segment in 2022 at 73% share in the U.S. We take the long view at Ford, and we are excited and optimistic about the future.
We know we are on the road to better.
Thank you for your interest in Ford Motor Company, and we invite you to read more about our progress and plans in this report.

FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 07 | | | | | | | FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Financial Highlights “ Our product portfolio has never been stronger – with new vehicles that are hits with customers.
We are making highly strategic capital allocation decisions to drive growth, strengthen our competitive position, and produce returns above our cost of capital.” JOHN LAWLER, FORD CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 2022 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS REVENUE: $158.1B (2021: $136.3B) NET INCOME/(LOSS): $(2.0)B (2021: $17.9B) ADJUSTED EBIT3: $10.4B (2021: $10.0B) ADJUSTED EBIT MARGIN3: 6.6% (2021: 7.3%) ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW3: $9.1B (2021: $4.6B) ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE3: $1.88 (2021: $1.59)  FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 08 | | | | | | | PEOPLE, PLAN, PRODUCTS POSITION FORD WELL FOR LONG TERM Ford made rapid progress carrying out its ambitious Ford+ plan for growth and value creation in 2022.
We have a world-class leadership team, made up of talented new and existing people that is helping us establish Ford as a leader in connected, electric vehicles.
Customers made us the number two seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. during the year.
Our financial performance was below our expectations due to higher-thanexpected costs and continued supply chain issues.
We are investing in key technologies and capabilities – such as software, electric vehicle (EV) platforms, and EV batteries that will help us break constraints to build more must-have products for customers and grow for decades to come.
We are working with urgency to improve our industrial platform, especially around quality and complexity reduction.
We generated a record $9.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow during the year, as disciplined capital allocation, exciting enhancements to our vehicle portfolio and changes to streamline and de-risk our regional businesses together yielded higher-quality growth and improved returns.
We have incredible products – both on the road and in the pipeline.
Our new vehicles are a hit with customers and our iconic nameplates remain market leaders.
In 2022, we began a complete overhaul of our industrial and quality operating system – product development, manufacturing and supply chain management – to deliver competitive cost and quality.
We are already seeing an uptick in the initial quality of vehicles coming out of our plants in North America.
Our transition to a new operating model became effective January 1, 2023.
We are now formally managing Ford according to three distinct, customer-focused business segments: Ford Blue, engineering iconic gas-powered and hybrid vehicles; Ford Model e, developing breakthrough EVs along with the digital platform and software for all our customers; and Ford Pro, helping commercial customers transform and expand their businesses with vehicles and services tailored to their needs.
All three are growth businesses.
This segmentation has given us greater clarity and insight into each of the businesses and puts us on the path to building a stronger, customer-focused Ford that generates sustainable, profitable growth and returns above our cost of capital.
Ford remains committed to making disciplined capital allocation choices about where to play and how to win, as evidenced by recent actions we have taken to restructure our operations outside of North America and divest our equity in Argo AI.
This is yielding results, as reflected by the healthy performance of the South America and International Markets Group units in 2022, which both generated sustainable levels of profitability.
Our balance sheet remains strong, as we ended the year with $32 billion of cash and $48 billion of liquidity.
This, coupled with improvement in adjusted free cash flow from our automotive operations, provides us with ample flexibility to both fund our Ford+ growth priorities and return capital to our shareholders.
Going forward, we intend to target distributions of 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow.
This year, 2023, is pivotal for Ford, as we deploy Ford+ to execute and deliver value to all our stakeholders.
Financial Highlights – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES WINNER Ford won the Green Debt Instruments Category at the 7th Annual Climate Bonds Awards and was recognized for issuing the largest-ever Green Bond from a nonfinancial U.S. corporation.
u u u $1.75B SECOND GREEN BOND ISSUED AUGUST 2022 $2.50B INAUGURAL GREEN BOND ISSUED NOVEMBER 2021 FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 09 | | | | | | | SUSTAINABLE FINANCING FRAMEWORK Ford introduced our Sustainable Financing Framework in 2021 to support the design, development and manufacture of our electric vehicles and create positive social and environmental benefits in the transition to EVs.
The net proceeds from each sustainable financing will be used to fund or refinance, in whole or in part, new or existing green or social projects, assets, or activities of Ford or Ford Credit.
The financing will be allocated and invested in four different areas: • Clean transportation • Clean manufacturing • Making lives better • Community revitalization Ford has established a Sustainable Finance Committee of senior leaders to oversee the project evaluation and selection process and to ensure selected projects comply with the eligibility criteria.
2022 Update In 2022, Ford issued its inaugural Sustainable Financing Report, highlighting first-year actions guided by the sustainable financing framework and an update on the allocation and impact of its 2021 Green Bond.
In 2021, Ford issued an inaugural Green Bond – a $2.5 billion transaction which at the time was the largest of its kind by a non-financial U.S.-based corporation.
A majority of the proceeds of the first Green Bond were allocated to clean transportation projects and the manufacture of Ford’s electric vehicle portfolio, including spending for vehicles available to customers now – the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit – and vehicles that will be unveiled in the future.
The remaining proceeds were allocated to development activities that will speed and expand introduction of breakthrough EVs into our product lineup.
These investments include the development of eDrive motors and the unique tech-stack architecture required for electric vehicles.
We have also allocated about $55 million of spending to Ion Park, our battery R&D center in Michigan.
A second Green Bond of $1.75 billion was issued in August 2022, proceeds from which Ford plans to allocate by the end of 2023.
We are proud that these investments are making a difference in the health of our planet and our business.
We continue to evolve our process to show the indelible link between our commitment to sustainability and our continued success.

OUR MATERIALITY PROCESS We conduct a materiality assessment every two years.
Our 2023 materiality assessment is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and has been updated to reflect emerging guidelines from GRI and the proposed European regulation CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive).
This Integrated Sustainability and Financial Report is structured to provide proof points and stories on Ford’s impacts on each of the material topics in the reporting period.
Our Material Topics In our 2023 sustainability materiality assessment, we identified five topics that have the highest impact on the environment and people, as well as our business and stakeholders.
These topics are listed in alphabetical order, as opposed to order of importance.
• Climate change and carbon neutrality • Electric vehicles, batteries and charging infrastructure • Human capital management and diversity, equity and inclusion • Human rights and supply chain management • Product safety and quality u SEE THE FULL TOPIC DEFINITIONS AND ASSOCIATED SUBTOPICS IN APPENDIX 1 ON P.112 It’s important to note that a like-for-like comparison is not possible with the 2021 materiality assessment, as we have evolved our approach to materiality and reviewed and grouped some of the topics, for example, environmental management now includes water, waste and biodiversity.
Government relations, sustainable business growth and accountable and inclusive governance are now grouped under corporate governance and risk management.
Moreover, ESG topics are often linked to one another, and their interdependencies must be considered.
For example, Just Transition sits u u at the intersection of many material topics, and for the purpose of this report, it is covered under human capital management.
Environmental justice, including climate justice, also sits at the intersection of many material topics, and is not called out in any one topic.

PREPARING TO LEAD THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE REVOLUTION Ford has an ambitious plan to lead the electric vehicle revolution.
We are on track to reach an annual targeted production run rate of 600,000 electric vehicles globally by the end of 2023, and 2 million by late 2026.
Electric vehicles are expected to account for half of Ford’s sales by 2030, and in Europe 100% of passenger cars are expected to be all-electric by 2030 and 100% of light commercial vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035.
Our plan to lead the electric revolution is based on four points: • Electrifying our icons, including Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit, scaling production to meet demand and creating new icons that compete in key segments of the market • Creating a robust EV supply chain from battery production to raw materials sourcing that upholds Ford’s sustainability and human rights commitments • Reimagining how EVs are built by creating an ultra-efficient EV manufacturing ecosystem • Expanding the BlueOval Charge Network and the FordPass Charging Network to instill confidence in EVs We are already making meaningful progress.
In the U.S., we are now the number two EV company.
In 2022, our EV sales grew at about twice the rate of the industry with more than 60% of our sales to customers new to Ford.
We are putting the industrial system in place to rapidly scale our EV production by building new battery and EV assembly capabilities and creating jobs.
In 2022, we broke ground at BlueOval City in Tennessee, the most advanced auto production complex in our history where we will assemble Ford’s next electric truck.
Construction is also underway on BlueOval SK battery plants in Kentucky.
In Europe, plants in Germany and Spain will be dedicated to EV production, and we are moving ahead with a new commercial vehicle battery facility in Turkey.
It’s all part of our strategy to achieve carbon neutrality globally no later than 2050.
Ford is proud to be one of the first U.S. automakers to align with the international community to limit global warming as part of the Paris Climate Agreement.
We also support the authority of California and other states to protect people’s health and combat climate change by establishing and enforcing air pollution standards and zero-emission vehicle requirements for new vehicles within their state.
And we are proud to be part of RouteZero, a global coalition working toward 100% zero-emissions cars and vans globally by 2040, and in leading markets no later than 2035. u READ MORE IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND CARBON NEUTRALITY SECTION ON P.41 ELECTRIFYING OUR ICONIC VEHICLES The demand for EVs is real – and growing.
For the first time, the majority of consumers who intend to buy a car in the next two years say they will choose an EV or hybrid vehicle, up 11% from 2021 and 22% from 2020, according to research published by EY.
Most of that increase in demand is for full EVs, and we are ready for them.
Our electric vehicle strategy is to play to our strengths and deliver an appealing lineup of iconic nameplates that our customers love and value.
We are focused on higher volumes and lower complexity to achieve scale and maximize margins per vehicle.
Customer reception to our first-generation electric vehicle lineup has exceeded our expectations.
There is no greater example of this than the F-150 Lightning, which represents a milestone in America’s shift to EVs.
Launched in April 2022, the F-150 Lightning is already America’s best-selling electric pickup9 thanks to features like its mega power frunk.
It is the smartest, most innovative F-150 that Ford has ever built, with the freedom of a 9.6-kilowatt smart power plant on wheels, over-the-air (OTA) software updates that will make it better over time and Built Ford Tough capability.
Built at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, a technologically and environmentally advanced EV manufacturing facility within Ford’s historic Rouge Complex, the F-150 Lightning follows the unprecedented success of the Ford F-Series, America’s best-selling truck for 46 years in a row10.
It’s also winning awards.
The F-150 Lightning was named 2023 MotorTrend truck of the year®, North AmericanTM Truck of the Year and Edmunds Top Rated Electric Truck for 2023.
Ford also introduced its first commercial EV in 2022 with E-Transit, the electric version of America’s best-selling commercial van and the first of two EVs purpose-built for Ford Pro commercial customers.
In 2022, it was the top-selling electric van in the U.S. with a 73% market share.
In Europe, E-Transit also was the best-selling EV in the two-ton segment, with a 25% share of the market.
The E-Transit is designed to deliver new levels of productivity to customers in the one-ton van segment.
Ford brought the global power of its research, engineering and software capabilities to bear on the E-Transit, combining advanced EV technology with Ford Pro’s digital ecosystem of software and services to help businesses reduce the cost of ownership, work more effectively, and simplify the transition to EVs.
Europe also announced the all-new E-Transit Custom in 2022, an all-electric version of the region’s best-selling van, with production starting in late 2023.
The Mustang Mach-E remains extremely popular, notching recognition as the second best-selling electric SUV in America with more than 150,000 vehicles produced.
2022 sales increased 45% over the prior year.
FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 24 | | | | | | | FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Electric Vehicles, Batteries and Charging Infrastructure – continued Ford is now offering the Mustang Mach-E in 37 countries worldwide with plans to add more markets next year.
More than eight in 10 Mustang Mach-E customers in the U.S. and nine in 10 customers in Europe have replaced an internal combustion vehicle with Mustang Mach-E. Ford Mustang Mach-E GT Twister Special Edition made its world debut at the 2022 Chengdu Motor Show.
With the Cyber Orange body color, this Special Edition references famous elements of Mustang’s classic “Twister”, including a Mustang family streetcar-style, paying tribute to real American classics.
Together the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit give Ford a compelling electric presence across three key vehicle categories and get us closer to a carbon neutral future.
And we are just getting started.
We are deep into the development of our second-generation EVs, including our future electric full-size pickup.
Using learnings from our first-generation EVs, they are being designed with a ground-up, systems-based approach that will unlock incredible complexity reduction and energy efficiency.
They will also be fully updatable leading to higher customer satisfaction and better quality.
EXPANDING OUR BATTERY CAPACITY Battery capacity and component sourcing is a key element of our EV strategy.
We have added battery chemistries and secured contracts delivering 60 gigawatt hours (GWh) of annual battery capacity, 100% of the annual battery cell capacity needed, to deliver a targeted global 600,000 EV run rate by late 2023.
We are adding lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cell chemistry to our portfolio, alongside our existing nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) chemistry.
This creates even more capacity for high-demand products and provides customers many years of operation with minimal range loss.
It also reduces the reliance on critical minerals such as nickel and, at current costs, brings a 10% bill of material savings versus NCM batteries.
Ford will introduce models with LFP battery packs for the Mustang Mach-E models for North America starting in 2023 as well as F-150 Lightning trucks in early 2024.
Ford’s EV architecture flexibility allows efficient incorporation of technology, delivering incremental capacity quickly to scale and meet customer demand.
We are leveraging our long-standing connection with our EV battery suppliers to meet our 2023 battery capacity target for Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit models and F-150 Lightning.
Securing Battery Cell Capacity Requirements We are building on agreements tied to our 600,000 run rate milestone and are taking them even further.
We are working on securing our battery cell capacity requirements to support an annual global run rate of more than 2 million EVs by late 2026.
To support these plans and our joint ventures for battery production, Ford has plans to localize battery capacity and is direct-sourcing battery cell raw materials in countries including the U.S., Australia and Indonesia.
We are working with major mining collaborators to source most of the nickel needed through 2026 and beyond.
We have also secured several key lithium contracts.
Ford continues working to localize processing of key battery materials in North America.
We are ensuring all of our battery materials work reflects and aligns with Ford’s responsible sourcing standards.

Innovations such as novel grab bars for ingress and egress and customizable vehicle sound for our customers with diverse hearing needs will allow our customers to have more choices in the private transport space.
Empowering Customers We want all our customers to have access to the electric vehicle revolution.
However, drivers with disabilities face specific challenges.
For example, ease of charging is a key purchase consideration for EVs12.
In response, Ford has developed a prototype robot charging station that drivers operate via their smartphone from inside their EV.
The technology could enable the driver to stay in the vehicle while charging, or to leave the vehicle while the robot does all the work.
Ford is testing the robot charging station as part of a research project to develop hands-free charging solutions for EVs and fully automatic charging for autonomous vehicles.
In the future, the robot charging station, custom-made by Dortmund University Department of Machine Elements, in Germany, could be installed at accessible parking spaces, in car parks or at private homes.
Further applications could include fast and efficient charging of company fleets.
The technology could also support more powerful charging to charge vehicles in a much shorter time and eventually even become fully automated.
And, when it comes to charging mobility assistive devices, the F-150 Lightning delivers the power customers need with four 120V outlets and two USB outlets.
The 2023 F-150 Lightning will launch with seven accessible and inclusive features as well as links to adaptive equipment to help with solutions.

Customer Engagement, Marketing and Satisfaction – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES INFLATION REDUCTION ACT INCENTIVES We expect the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act to have a positive impact for our customers.
Commercial customers can claim up to $7,500 per EV, and we estimate that most of our commercial customers will be able to monetize this tax credit.
There are charging benefits as well.
Businesses that purchase and install EV charging equipment may be eligible for credits up to 30% of the cost of the equipment, depending on their situation.
Qualifying government entities including states, counties, and cities may also take advantage of the commercial clean vehicles tax credit because the Inflation Reduction Act creates a way for such taxexempt entities to get a monetary benefit.
For our retail customers, the Inflation Reduction Act authorizes tax credits up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV or PHEV.
The U.S. government is phasing in the eligibility criteria for this tax credit, which include criteria regarding where the vehicle is assembled, the income of the purchaser, the retail price of the vehicle, and the source of the critical minerals and components to make the vehicle’s battery.
Ford will continue to communicate with our customers about these criteria, and help them understand whether they can benefit from this clean vehicle tax credit.
We also anticipate that the EU Green Deal will have a positive impact for our customers and the green electrification of mobility in the affected regions.
We expect European mandates for more EV charging infrastructure will support European customers in migrating to fully electric vehicles.

As a leader in the electric vehicle revolution, Ford is resolved to preserve or create the conditions our planet needs to thrive.
This past year, alongside our partners across the globe, we have made measurable gains against tough environmental sustainability targets.
Our investments in greener manufacturing are fueling the transition to carbon neutrality and achieving the positive impact that is essential to our future.
OUR SUSTAINABILITY ASPIRATIONS Climate Change: Achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2050 Materials: Utilize only recycled or renewable content in vehicle plastics Energy: Use 100 percent carbon-free electricity in all manufacturing by 2035 Water: Make zero water withdrawals for manufacturing processes Use freshwater only for human consumption Air: Attain zero emissions from our vehicles and facilities Waste: Reach true zero waste to landfill across our operations Eliminate single-use plastics from our operations by 2030 We are accelerating our progress to carbon neutrality Backed by science-based targets, our goal to carbon neutrality no later than 2050 encompasses our vehicles, facilities, and suppliers.
We are on the path to an electric world Around the world, we are dedicating more than $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 to accelerate our zero-emission vehicle plan and create an ultraefficient manufacturing system for our vehicles and the batteries that power them.
We are on track to reach our targeted annual run rate of 600,000 EVs by late 2023 and more than 2 million by the end of 2026.
By 2030, we expect half of our global vehicle sales volume will be electric.
We are committed to environmental leadership From water to energy and source materials, our commitment to environmental leadership and sustainability focuses on what we build and how we build.
Using energy more efficiently, procuring power from carbon-free sources, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our operations, and making our transportation and logistics more sustainable all play a role in reaching carbon neutrality.
Sustainable Development Goals We are contributing to the following UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through actions outlined in this chapter: FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 40 | | | | | | | FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality Climate Change: Achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2050 We believe that climate change is among the biggest challenges of our generation.
READ MORE ABOUT OUR PROGRESS ON THIS SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IN OUR HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS REPORT ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY We are doing our part by taking urgent action to achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2050 – and in Europe no later than 2035 – by focusing on three areas that account for approximately 95% of our carbon emissions: our vehicles, operations and supply chain.
On our way to carbon neutrality, we will reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, as defined by the GHG Protocol.
The path will not be linear, and the relative share of GHG emissions for each scope will shift over time.
The Carbon Neutrality Scenario graph shows what this path might look like.
As we sell more EVs, the total GHG emissions from vehicle use should decrease significantly.
The tailpipe GHG emissions from vehicle use decrease as ICE vehicle sales decrease, but the GHG emissions from energy production increase due to more electricity use.
If we still have some remaining CARBON NEUTRALITY SCENARIO hard-to-reduce GHG emissions at 2050, we intend to neutralize these emissions using carbon removals, aligned with guidance from SBTi.
Carbon removals can be natural or technical strategies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere and provide secure long-term storage.
Our Commitments Our goals are backed by science-based targets approved by SBTi: • Reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our operations by 76% by 2035 from a 2017 baseline • Reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from the use of sold products by 50% per vehicle km by 2035 from a 2019 baseline Our Scope 1 and 2 operations target is aligned with the SBTi 1.5°C path, while our Scope 3 use of sold products (vehicles) target is consistent with the well-below 2°C path14.
These targets do not include offsets and are strictly GHG reduction targets.
Our Scope 3 target goes beyond tailpipe emissions, and includes reducing vehicle emissions from a fuel-cycle perspective (well-to-wheels) which includes the production and consumption of energy during vehicle use.

Major updates to the production facility, with new energy efficient solutions, will save more than 2,000 metric tons of CO2 e and more than 2,600 megawatt hours (MWh) of electric energy per year.
The first European-built, all-electric passenger vehicle for European customers will be produced at the facility from 2023, with a second all-electric vehicle in 2024.
Together with our Cologne plant, our BlueOval City electric vehicle center in Tennessee is leading the way as we reimagine how EVs and batteries are designed, built and recycled.
By 2025, we are expecting all of Ford’s electricity supply in Michigan to be attributed to clean energy and every Ford vehicle manufactured in Michigan to be assembled with the equivalent of 100% carbon-free electricity, 10 years earlier than Ford’s global goal.
In Mexico, all of our manufacturing locations are now powered with 100% carbon-free electricity, and all of our Ohio manufacturing facilities achieved 100% carbon-free electricity sourcing in 2022.
We are also ensuring that our new offices are energy efficient.
Our Research and Engineering and Corktown campuses are expected to achieve an Energy Utilization Intensity that is 50% better than historical Ford office spaces.
In Dearborn, we are transforming the Research and Engineering Center into a high-tech, efficient and forward-thinking campus that is designed to be carbon neutral when it is occupied in 2025.
Our energy efficiency efforts are being recognized.
We were proud to receive Norfolk Southern Corporation’s inaugural Thoroughbred Sustainability Partner award for energy efficiency.

However, such a transition comes with challenges that must be addressed.
As we take leadership of the electric vehicle revolution, Ford supports a just transition by preparing our workforce and local communities for the transition to EVs.
Ford supports environmental justice by protecting communities from environmental and health hazards and providing meaningful involvement in our decision-making processes.
Ford supports climate justice, and the growing understanding that the impacts of climate change will not be felt equitably among all communities.
READ MORE ABOUT JUST TRANSITION IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS REPORT READ MORE ABOUT CLIMATE JUSTICE IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT FIRST MOVERS COALITION The First Movers Coalition is a global initiative to harness purchasing power and supply chains to create early markets for innovative clean energy technologies.
More than 50 companies with a collective market value of about $8.5 trillion across five continents make up the coalition to help drive demand for zero-carbon technologies.
Ford has pledged that at least 10% of the company’s primary aluminum and steel purchases will have near-zero carbon emissions by 2030.
A multi-materials partnership will support the transition toward a carbon-neutral future by supplying Ford with materials including lithium, low-carbon aluminum, and copper.
The companies will work together to strengthen the supply of low carbon aluminum for use in Ford vehicles, helping us meet our commitment to the First Movers Coalition.
Ford in Europe is taking further steps to secure supply of low-carbon steel for future products and help reach its carbon neutrality target by 2035.
The company is entering into non-binding memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with strategic steel suppliers to secure a supply of low-carbon steel and significantly improve the CO2 footprint of our supply chain, of which steel production is a key component.
As a first application Ford plans to use the low-carbon steel for the production of its all-new, all-electric, medium-sized crossover vehicle, starting in 2023. u u  FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 45 | | | | | | | “ Reducing emissions to carbon neutral by 2050 is possible if we invest in the right technologies and bring them to scale within the next decade.
By joining the First Movers Coalition, Ford is signaling to the market that we want to work with our suppliers to achieve commercially viable green steel and aluminum.
The intent and significance of our commitment today has the potential to help build the carbon neutral economy.” SUE SLAUGHTER, FORD DIRECTOR OF SUPPLY CHAIN SUSTAINABILITY Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES MANUFACTURE 2030 Ford is among the first American automakers to include its global supply chain on the Manufacture 2030 (M2030) platform.
This online tool, along with Climate Action Managers, will provide support for our suppliers with measurement, management and reduction of carbon emissions, water and waste as Ford strives to reach carbon neutrality globally.
The move builds on guidance Ford issued to suppliers requiring they establish science-based GHG reduction targets, action plans, and transparent reporting mechanisms to minimize their impact on climate change.
M2030 also builds on, scales up and replaces our internal best practice program Partnership for A Cleaner Environment.
Not only will this new program provide support to our suppliers in building a plan toward carbon neutrality, but it will also help Ford identify and prioritize key focus areas and those suppliers requiring extra support.
Carbon neutrality will become an increasing focus in our sourcing decisions throughout 2023.
In the first phase of the partnership with M2030, Ford offered the voluntary platform to 3,000 Tier 1 global supplier sites, including suppliers who have yet to establish science-based targets.
 DECARBONIZING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN Our supply chain is essential to achieving our carbon neutrality goals.
This will require cutting emissions across our entire value chain, particularly from purchased energy, goods and services.
Our goal is to ensure that everything we make – or that others make for us – upholds the highest sustainability standards.
Ford has outlined conduct guidelines for its suppliers since 2003, and in 2021, established a formal Supplier Code of Conduct that applies clear expectations related to human rights, the environment, responsible material sourcing and lawful business practices for every supplier.
The Supplier Code of Conduct requires Ford suppliers to establish sciencebased GHG reduction targets, action plans, and transparent reporting mechanisms aligned with the Paris Agreement to minimize their impact on climate change.
In 2022, we ran internally mandatory environmental training for Ford’s Supply Chain team.
In 2022, Ford trained 2,647 employees in addition to 844 purchasing employees in Supply Chain Sustainability topics.
Ford also trained 979 suppliers in various sustainability-related topics.
All our production suppliers were required to submit their GHG reduction targets by the end of 2022.
We will use this information to develop a joint roadmap with them on our journey toward carbon neutrality.
We use internal targets for increasing engagement with our supply chain partners, including building on our successful CDP Supply Chain reporting program and our internal best practice Partnership for A Cleaner Environment (PACE) program.
In 2022, we joined two supply chain initiatives that will help us achieve our climate goals: First Movers Coalition and Manufacture 2030, which has replaced PACE.
PARTNERSHIPS Addressing climate change requires collaboration with multiple partners and organizations in the public and private sectors to drive progress.
Together we face challenges including customer acceptance of electric vehicles, government regulations, economic factors and the availability of carbon neutral electricity and renewable fuels.
We hope that all business leaders will join us in addressing climate change with the urgency that’s needed to meet the crisis and will partner with government stakeholders to find solutions.
Public-private partnerships are essential to making the transition to electric vehicles on the timeline needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.
We are enthusiastically supportive of consumer EV incentives to accelerate that transition by making electric vehicles even more affordable while supporting manufacturing jobs.
We are working with government partners to secure the supply chains and develop the technologies we need to produce the batteries and vehicles of the future here in the U.S. We partner with groups including the Climate Leadership Council and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions Business and Environmental Leadership Council to demonstrate our leadership and advocate for stronger GHG policy, climate resiliency, and infrastructure that helps remove obstacles and builds the market for EVs.

POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT REPORT MEASURING OUR VEHICLE CARBON FOOTPRINT Life Cycle Assessment of Our Vehicles Reducing GHG emissions associated with the use of our vehicles is critical as we work toward our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.
Understanding the potential environmental and cost impacts of our vehicles or services over their life cycle – from the acquisition of raw materials, through vehicle production, distribution and use, to end-of-life disposal or recycling – helps us reduce our environmental footprint.
Vehicle use is the main source of GHG emissions.
Use-phase CO2 emissions depend not just on vehicle design, but also the energy source and the way the vehicles are driven.
Using the GHG Protocol methodology and preliminary data to estimate emissions from vehicle on-road use, we calculate that our vehicles sold in 2022 will produce approximately 287 million metric tons of CO2e from fuel production and combustion over a 150,000-mile lifetime, on a well-to-wheels basis.
In addition to our focus on improving tailpipe or tank-to-wheels (TTW) emissions, we also continue to study well-to-wheels (WTW) impacts in alignment with our carbon neutrality goal.
These include the production well-to-tank (WTT) and TTW consumption of fuel and electricity during vehicle use.
WTW emissions vary between vehicle, propulsion system, and energy source.
Our Scope 3 SBTi vehicle CO2 emissions target is based on WTW emissions.
While WTT emissions are part of the total vehicle life cycle, they are beyond our direct control.
Consequently, we collaborate with a range of partners, including fuel and electricity producers, infrastructure developers, and governments, to address these impacts.
As the electric grid continues to shift to carbon-free energy sources, CO2 emissions from electricity production are expected to further decrease creating even greater CO2 emissions savings.

Reducing Carbon Dioxide Emissions Alternative fuel vehicles enable our customers to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions footprint during the transition to electric vehicles.
Depending on infrastructure, technology development, policy, and customer acceptance, our path toward zero-emission cars and vans globally will be powered by some combination of electricity, hydrogen, and hydrocarbon fuels from sustainable sources.
Examples of hydrocarbon fuels are sustainable biofuels and fuels synthesized from electricity, water, and carbon.
Synthetic fuels made from electricity are often called “e-fuels.” We anticipate that different regions will adopt different solutions and different mixes of electricity, hydrogen, and hydrocarbon fuels.
According to Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET 2022 model, compared to conventional PFI gasoline engine with 10% ethanol (E10) vehicles, GHG emissions are about 15% lower for diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, 25% lower for 20% biodiesel blend (B20) vehicles and 30% lower for 85% ethanol from corn (E85) vehicles.
Even more reduction is possible with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles with 55% lower GHGs using hydrogen from steam methane reforming.
EVs reduce emissions even more with almost 60% lower emissions when charged with U.S. average grid electricity.
When hydrogen and electricity are produced using carbon-free energy, the in-use GHG reduction is up to 100% on a well-to-wheels basis.
We offer our customers many vehicles that are capable of using these reduced-GHG fuels.
All our diesel vehicles are compatible with low-level biodiesel blends including B20 in the U.S., Thailand, and Malaysia; B7 in Europe; B30 in Indonesia; and B15 in Brazil.
Also in Europe, our Transit, Transit Custom, Transit Courier, Transit Connect, and Ranger are compatible with renewable paraffinic diesel fuels such as HVO, renewable diesel and e-diesel, and can be used at higher blends, typically from 33% to 100%.
Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Developing Alternative Fuel Options Ford continues to research and develop alternative powertrains and fuel options to provide customers with efficient, low-carbon alternatives across all our vehicles as we move toward carbon neutrality.
Our efforts include the development of hydrogen fuel cell technology for our Medium and Heavy-Duty vehicles.
In partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) we will develop and demonstrate hydrogen fuel cell electric Class-5 Super Duty trucks through the DOE SuperTruck 3 program.
With this project, we intend to show that fuel cell electric technology offers cost, payload, towing, and refueling times that are equivalent to conventional gasoline and diesel trucks.
In motorsports, a next-generation Ranger Raptor, race-prepped but remaining stock and street legal, finished the SCORE-International Baja 1000, one of the world’s toughest and most prestigious off-road races, in first place amongst the stock classes, then drove back to base in Riverside, California.
The nearly flawless Ford Performance global effort was powered by low carbon biofuel blend which consists of more than 30% sustainably sourced bio components.
The Ranger Raptor’s success in the race demonstrates that commitment to sustainability does not require compromising performance.
In two 2022 studies, Ford researchers helped document the critical importance of low carbon energy and fuels in the transition to zeroemission vehicles.

We are working toward sourcing 100% carbon-free electricity for our global manufacturing by 2035 through a mix of wind, solar, nuclear, geothermal, biomass, and hydro.
Increasing the percentage of carbon-free electricity consumed in Ford’s global manufacturing plants is one of our sustainability-linked performance metrics.
We are making good progress.
In 2022: • 60.6% of electricity for our global manufacturing operations was carbon-free.
• 42.6% of electricity from global operations was renewable.
• All purchased electricity for European operations is now renewable.
• All of our manufacturing locations in Mexico are now powered with 100% carbon-free electricity.
• All of our manufacturing facilities in Ohio achieved 100% carbon-free electricity sourcing in 2022.
• We are on track to source 100% carbon-free electricity in Michigan by 2025 through partnerships with local utilities.
Modernizing Plants for Energy Efficiency Energy efficiency is a priority as we modernize existing plants and design new ones.
Ford continues to focus on developing and implementing facility infrastructure projects at existing manufacturing facilities to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions.
The $2 billion conversion of our Cologne, Germany plant operations includes energy efficiency solutions that are projected to save 2,600 MWh of power and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 2,000 metric tons of CO2e annually.
In 2022, Ford implemented energy efficiency projects at multiple manufacturing locations in North America with a total implementation cost of more than $26 million; these projects are expected to reduce energy consumption by more than 21,000 MWh and GHG emissions by more than 12,400 metric tonnes.

As part of the agreement, DTE will add 650 megawatts of new solar energy capacity in Michigan for Ford by 2025.
The purchase is a strategic investment in Michigan through DTE’s MIGreenPower program and is the largest renewable energy purchase ever made in the U.S. from a utility.
According to data collected by the Solar Energy Industries Association, once installed, the arrays will increase the total amount of installed solar energy in Michigan by nearly 70%.
By 2025, we expect every Ford vehicle manufactured in Michigan to be assembled with the equivalent of 100% carbon-free electricity, 10 years earlier than Ford’s global goal.
Ford’s purchase of carbon-free electricity will avoid as much as 600,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions annually, improve the local environment and add resiliency to the local grid.

As we move to an all-electric future and carbon neutrality across our manufacturing footprint at Ford, investments in innovations like this new solar power plant in Valencia are important contributions in our ongoing ambition to help build a better world.” STUART SOUTHGATE, DIRECTOR, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY COMPLIANCE, FORD OF EUROPE Renewable Energy Ford’s Dunton, Dagenham, and Daventry facilities in the U.K., the Craiova plant in Romania, and all facilities in Cologne, Germany including the vehicle assembly and engine plants, as well as the Research Center in Merkenich, and the Valencia plant in Spain are powered by 100% carbonfree electricity.
We have installed a 2.8 megawatt-peak (MWp) solar array at Valencia and that will be increased to 4.9 MWp in 2023.
Ford in Argentina, South America, achieved 60% of carbon free electricity.
The Pacheco Manufacturing Plant in Argentina is on track to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2024.
Also, Ford’s Tatuí Proving Ground in Brazil has used 100% renewable electricity since 2021.
The Ford Silverton Assembly Plant in Pretoria, which expanded production of the all-new Ranger pickup truck in 2022, continues to move toward energy self-sufficiency and carbon neutrality.
The first phase of the plant’s Project BlueOval is showing results with the site now sourcing 35% of its electricity from solar power through the installation of solar photovoltaic carports for 3,600 vehicles.
This solar array at the Silverton plant generates 13 megawatts (MW) of on-site solar energy reducing carbon emissions by more than 20,000 metric tons of CO2e annually.
A new solar plant at our Almussafes manufacturing facilities in Valencia is one more step toward Ford’s goal of carbon neutrality across our European footprint of facilities, logistics and Tier 1 suppliers by 2035.
The photovoltaic area, that converts solar energy into electricity, features two zones of solar panels that are capable of producing the equivalent power every year to run 1,400 average homes.
The initial production of close to 4,641 MWh per year will increase in 2023 by 3,762 MWh per year, the equivalent of 1,100 additional average homes.
In practice, this means that Ford’s Valencia factory will be making a meaningful reduction in its current electricity demand from the national grid this year.
Ford is looking to expand the areas of solar panels on further nonproductive land targeting to reach 10 megawatts of peak power by 2024.
The feasibility of potential future solar panel installations on the roofs of factory buildings is also being studied.
Solar energy is also playing a key role in Thailand, South Africa, and China, where installations of on-site solar projects continue.
In Thailand, the AAT plant is generating 5 MW of on-site solar power.
In China, the Changan Ford Hangzhou Plant continues to reap the benefits from the installation of solar photovoltaic panels in 2019 and 2022 where the annual solar power supply now accounts for more than 30% of the total power consumption of the plant – up from 25% in 2020.
The Ford Joint Venture Jiangling Automobile production plants also have a planned installation of solar voltaic panels that are expected to generate 63 MW of solar power and reduce carbon emissions by more than 45,000 metric tons of CO2e annually.
FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 50 | | | | | | | FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Circular Economy and End-of-Life Materials: Utilize only recycled or renewable content in vehicle plastics Using recycled and renewable materials in our vehicles’ design enables us to both reduce landfill waste and use fewer natural resources.
Over 85%4 of vehicle parts and materials are recycled and reused at their end of life.
Understanding that the metallic portions of vehicles are already highly recycled, we are focusing on recycled and renewable content in plastics.
PLASTIC IN VEHICLES The average SUV contains more than 750 pounds of plastic.
By increasing the sustainability of plastics in our vehicles’ design, we can make a beneficial impact on the environment – and our business.
By 2025 we aim to use 20% recycled and renewable plastics in new vehicle designs for North America, Europe and now also Turkey.
Our target for China is 10%.
Our broader aspiration is to utilize only recycled or renewable content in vehicle plastics.
Ford has begun the process of tracking the recycled and renewable content on pilot programs and will continue work to operationalize the process for future programs.
Waste products generated by other industries comprise much of our recycled and renewable content.
We use the ISO 14021 standard to account for this content.
When tracking our status for recycled content, we use the part inventory list associated with the high volume variant available for each program.
Using Recycled Materials for Vehicle Parts While not every polymer can easily use recycled material, there is potential for recycling to reduce the carbon footprint of some of our plastics by 70-90%.
Through activities such as transforming recycled plastic bottles into vehicle parts we are helping to play a major role in promoting environmentally friendly auto parts.
Due to its light weight, recycled plastic is ideal for the manufacture of underbody shields, engine under shields and front and rear wheel arch liners that can help improve vehicle aerodynamics.
We also use postconsumer nylon and polypropylene carpeting for cylinder head covers, fans and shrouds, cam covers, and carbon canisters.
Converting CO2 to Polyurethane Foam Ford has been awarded a grant by the U.S. Department of Energy to conduct research on using CO2 as a feedstock to make polyurethane foams.
The $2.5 million grant is one of 30 DOE projects to help decarbonize the U.S. industrial sector, advance clean manufacturing and improve America’s economic competitiveness.
Using polyols that are derived from captured waste CO2, Ford will develop and scale up technology to produce polyurethane foams used for automobiles for seating and other applications such as for crash protection and noise, vibration, and harshness reduction.
Machine learning will be used to accelerate the development and formulation of the polyol molecular platform and foams to meet manufacturability, performance, and cost metrics while improving sustainability as measured through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).
Using Renewable Materials for Vehicle Parts Renewable, plant-based materials are also part of our sustainability strategy.
Ford is a leader in this space, using nine plant-based materials in current and past vehicle production.
These robust materials have multiple benefits including enabling lighter weight parts that improve fuel economy, sequestering carbon and reducing global warming impacts.
They also require less energy to manufacture.
Our industry-first sustainable materials include soy foam, wheat straw, rice hulls, tree-based cellulose, and coffee chaff.
Soy seat cushions, backs and headrests were one of many Ford firsts.
They have been used in every Ford North American built vehicle for more than a decade, over 18.5 million vehicles.
Bio-based foams have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by over 228 million pounds, and use of soy foam, launched on Mustang and now on all American vehicles, has helped save 5 million pounds of petroleum annually since 2008.
Our Advanced Polymer Technologies team continues to pioneer the development of new sustainable plastic materials including using waste from olive production to reinforce plastics, captured carbon dioxide in plastic formulation and polymer resins made from renewable feed stocks.
For example, we are testing whether the tree-based cellulose composites, that were incorporated into Lincoln Continental consoles, can be used in other applications.

BATTERY RECYCLING Ford views batteries of end-of-life vehicles as a crucial part of our supply chain, and are committed to increasing battery recycling over time.
To further these efforts we are supporting various battery recycling companies, including with letters of support for US DOE grants.
In Europe, new regulations will require manufacturers to report on their extended producer responsibility for proper battery recycling.
In advance of the European Battery Regulation, we are partnering with Everledger to pilot a battery passport.
The pilot leverages Everledger’s technology platform to track EV batteries throughout their life cycle to ensure responsible management during use and recycling at the end of their useful life.
This will allow Ford to gain visibility on out-of-warranty batteries, validate responsible end-of-life recycling, and gain access to data such as recycled critical minerals produced and associated carbon dioxide emissions savings.
RECYCLED BATTERIES ARE POWERING WATERSHED Ford has partnered with the dealer network, Motolite Ramcar Battery and Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP) to advocate the proper disposal and legitimate recycling of used lead acid batteries.
Through this partnership, Motolite is donating to PBSP an amount for every battery collected from each dealer group.
The fund, which is augmented by a $25,000 grant from Ford, will be used for the rehabilitation of the Marikina and Buhisan watersheds in the Philippines.
Local partners began planting in late 2022.
Ford and dealer employees will join the tree planting effort in July 2023.
CLOSING THE LOOP IN ALUMINUM RECYCLING Ford’s closed loop recycling system maximizes aluminum recycling in our plants and minimizes the need for primary metal.
As the largest automotive aluminum recycler in the world, we have worked closely with our aluminum sheet suppliers to create unique alloys.
Our system recovers aluminum scrap during parts stamping but keeps the various aluminum alloys separated so they can be recycled back into fresh alloy for new vehicles.
We currently recycle up to 20 million pounds of aluminum each month at our Dearborn Stamping, Kentucky Truck and Buffalo Stamping facilities.
This represents 20-30% of our aluminum sheet coil purchases.
Making recycled aluminum only takes around 5% of the energy needed to make new aluminum, according to the Aluminum Association, and minimizes the need for primary metal.

Remanufacturing turns a previously used, sold or worn-out part into a like-new or better-than-new condition which can be warranted in performance level and quality.
Remanufacturing saves considerable energy, utilizes much less raw material compared to a new unit, substantially reduces CO2 emissions, and helps extend the life cycle of the vehicle product line.
Since Henry Ford introduced remanufacturing in response to WWII shortages of steel and iron, Ford has remanufactured powertrain assemblies, turbos, injectors, steering components, brake components, electronic modules and starters/alternators.
Reclaimed powertrain material supports Ford sustainability objectives.
In 2022, we reclaimed 3,794 metric tons of steel and 2,777 metric tons of aluminum from transmission material and 1,284 metric tons of cast iron, 289 metric tons of steel and 515 metric tons of aluminum from engine material.
Combined, Ford supplied 104,000 remanufactured engines and transmissions in the U.S.
Going forward, we are looking to expand the program beyond Ford Blue and remanufacture certain components of our EVs.
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Research and Regulations We conduct LCA-based studies to evaluate potential environmental implications of vehicle raw materials and manufacturing; for example, aluminum production and recycling, recycled polymers, cradle-to-gate impacts of lithium-ion batteries, environmental benefits of using secondlife EV batteries, and additive manufacturing.

Reducing emissions from our vehicles and facilities will reduce air pollution, help protect people’s health, and combat climate change.
u READ MORE ABOUT OUR PROGRESS ON THIS SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IN OUR HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS REPORT As air quality standards become increasingly stringent around the world, we continue our work to reduce emissions of air pollutants (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter).
These pollutants, which are emitted by internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles can affect air quality and can potentially impact human health.
In addition, brake particulates and electricity generation for electric vehicles (EVs) can impact air quality.
Global criteria emission standards have led to lower vehicle emissions and, in turn, to major improvements in air quality.
We are proud to meet or exceed all global criteria emission standards as they are introduced.
For example, we have lowered tailpipe criteria emissions by between 15% and 55% for 90% of the Class 2b–721 commercial vehicles we will produce in 2023 model year.
We have also reduced tailpipe criteria emissions in the Class 2b–7 commercial vehicle segments by 10–35% relative to the outgoing 2022 model year products.
For diesel we lowered tailpipe criteria emissions by 15% – 55% in our Class 2b–7 commercial vehicles equipped with diesel engines relative to 2022 model year.
In addition to reducing GHG emissions, our electric vehicle strategy is aimed at helping to improve local air quality.
Access to EVs can help provide health, economic, and mobility benefits, especially in communities that bear a disproportionate burden from climate change and air pollution.
TIGHTENING STANDARDS Plans to implement 100% zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales targets are underway or anticipated in several countries and states.
The EU is mandating that all new vehicle sales in the EU be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.
Some European countries have regulations in place or are working on regulations that will advance this date even further for those countries.
And in California, the California Air Resources Board voted in 2022 to rapidly scale down light-duty passenger car, truck and SUV emissions starting with the 2026 model year through 2035.
Under the new guidelines, by 2035 all new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in California will have zero emissions22.
Ford supports California’s actions to strengthen vehicle emission standards and expects this landmark standard to be adopted by other U.S. states.
Our Progress in China From 2021 to 2022, Ford manufacturing plants in China reduced VOC emission intensity over 40% (8 g/m2), equivalent to an annual reduction of over 500 metric tons of VOC emissions through various management and engineering investment measures, contributing to cleaner air.

u READ MORE ABOUT OUR PROGRESS ON THIS SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IN OUR HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS REPORT We consider freshwater to include both surface water and groundwater.
This is aligned with, and extends beyond, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) definition of freshwater as surface water.
Our 2025 Global Manufacturing Water Strategy targets a 15% reduction in absolute freshwater usage from a 2019 base year.
In 2022, our absolute freshwater reduction was 21.7%.
While lower production volumes played a role in that reduction, we made great progress in implementing water reduction projects that will contribute to sustained water savings.
Since 2000, we have achieved a 76.2% reduction in annual water use, accounting for 186.3 cumulative gallons of water.
Through integrating more water efficient processes and technologies in our manufacturing systems to further decrease our water consumption, our water conservation actions are equal to providing a year’s worth of water to 1.7 million homes.
We are committed to extraction policies and practices that ensure our operations don’t restrict other users’ access to water.
One example is our efforts around utilizing alternative water sources, like rainwater and wastewater from other organizations, for our manufacturing processes.
ACHIEVING ZERO FRESHWATER FOR MANUFACTURING Our Irapuato Transmission Plant in Mexico achieved zero freshwater usage for manufacturing in 2022.
This was accomplished through a combination of ensuring excess water was not used, end of pipe recycling, and securing a source of treated wastewater from an offsite location.
The Irapuato Transmission Plant is the second Ford facility to achieve the zero freshwater for manufacturing goal, joining the Chihuahua Engine facility.
In 2022, our use of alternative water was 8% in the water scarce areas.
In addition to improving water quality discharges at our sites, we are applying freshwater reduction methods at our sites that mimic the behavior and performance of the local ecosystem.
u READ ABOUT WATER USAGE AT BLUEOVAL CITY ON P.26 WATER RECYCLING Our Louisville Assembly Plant was recognized by the EPA in 2022 for its leadership and commitment to practices that reduce, eliminate or prevent pollution at its source, specifically for a new water recycling initiative.

During 2022, the Plant avoided the withdrawal of more than 7 million gallons of city water use, which equates to over 32 gallons per vehicle of freshwater avoidance.
Our CDP A List Achievements Ford earned a place on the CDP “A List” for protecting water security again in 2022.
We have received an A score rating from CDP for water reduction for eight years in a row and are one of only 107 companies globally to earn such an award for water security.
We were also on CDP’s Climate Change “A list” for the fourth straight year.
Ford is the only automotive OEM globally to earn a double A in 2022 for Climate Change and Water Security23.

Not only does it reduce our impact on the planet, but it also optimizes efficiency in our resourceintensive industry.
We aspire to reach true zero waste to landfill and to eliminate single-use plastics by 2030 across our global operations.
Reducing waste has a dual benefit.
Not only does it reduce our impact on the planet, but it also optimizes efficiency in our resource-intensive industry.
By reducing or recycling generated waste, we can avoid the landfill, reduce GHG emissions, and generate an additional supply of valuable resources.
WASTE STRATEGY RESULTS In 2017, we launched the second phase of our global waste management strategy which was focused on minimizing waste generated from highvolume streams and managing the waste we generate to avoid landfill disposal.
While we fell short on two of the three per vehicle reduction targets, we did achieve absolute reductions of 24% in waste sent to landfill, 51% in waste generation, and 61% in general trash.
Disruptions in production due to COVID and chip shortages played a pivotal role in our manufacturing efficiency and therefore our ability to progress toward strategic waste targets.
We also overcame several significant waste to energy and recycling facility closures which impacted waste to landfill progress.
Currently, we have 84 zero waste to landfill sites globally.
In 2022, Ford facilities around the world sent approximately 18,400 metric tons of waste to landfill, 14% more than in 2021.
All Ford manufacturing plants in China operate with zero waste to landfill (ZWTL).
Waste generated in all factories is either recycled or managed for thermal destruction with or without energy recovery instead of being sent to landfills for final disposal.
Our European facilities have all achieved ZWTL status, using the same strategies.
It’s essential that our plants have the resources needed to collect and manage waste.
Our North American manufacturing organization dedicated $3 million in 2022 to increase collection containers and equipment within plants to help them meet our global waste standard, a minimum set of requirements for the manufacturing plants to successfully pursue our waste-related sustainability targets.
To ensure that more of our facilities reach ZWTL status, we continue to implement a range of waste reduction initiatives.
Ongoing initiatives include: • Implementing new technologies and programs that minimize waste • Standardizing the tracking and sorting of waste to increase recycling and reuse The next phase of our waste strategy will span from 2023 to 2027 and focus on reducing overall waste generation and improving our overall environmental footprint by recognizing waste reduction opportunities.
We will continue to drive waste sent to landfill reductions globally and progress toward our zero waste to landfill goal.
As with the other strategies, we have progressed toward targeting absolute reductions in the waste strategy so that we can more clearly define our impact to the environment and surrounding communities.
Eliminating Single-use Plastics We continue initiatives around the world toward our goal of eliminating single-use plastics.
Regional efforts include returnable containers for take-away food in Cologne, Germany and phasing out single-use plastic utensils in all our facilities in U.S. and Canada.
Reducing Packaging Impact Protecting components on their journey to our facilities is essential.
Using standardized packaging containers and materials helps to optimize payloads and lower costs.
We have agreements with packaging providers in many locations to collect and store containers and to forward them to other suppliers for reuse.
Our focus on packaging begins before a new vehicle is launched.
Working with our suppliers we review packaging for components and production parts with a view to reduce environmental impact and increase the use of eco-friendly packaging.
Suppliers in North America and Asia Pacific are required to use packaging that has a neutral, if not positive, environmental footprint, achieved by using 100% recycled, renewable or recyclable materials.
Reducing End-of-Life Impacts We proactively review non-dimensional materials such as lubricants and paints within our manufacturing operations.
Going beyond applicable regulations, we are developing a timeline to further reduce substances of concern in our facilities, including those that are carcinogenic or environmentally persistent.

The World Economic Forum identified ‘biodiversity loss’ as the third most severe risk on a global scale over the next ten years.
We are committed to developing solutions to preserve biodiversity and restore ecosystems across our facilities and the surrounding communities through programs like the Ford Wildlife Foundation (FWF) and the Bronco Wild Fund.
The FWF is making important contributions to biodiversity, environmental conservation and awareness through its support of 26 leading conservation organizations across South Africa and in Mozambique.
By donating new locally built Ford Ranger Double Cab 4x4s to its conservation partners, FWF is providing crucial mobility for the teams to implement their wide-ranging environmental projects and helping them protect threatened species and ensure the rich biodiversity of the region.
In addition to supporting the annual United Nations World Environment Day, this effort reinforces Ford’s commitment to care for each other.
Ford’s Bronco Wild Fund is dedicated to building a legacy of access, preservation and stewardship from the ground up.
Its mission is rooted in an unwavering and substantial pledge from Ford to protect natural resources and the environment.
The Bronco Wild Fund is teaming up with like-minded collaborators to provide grants, scholarships, contributions and an extensive dealer network to keep the great outdoors great.
A portion of the profits from every Bronco sold goes directly to Bronco Wild Fund collaborator initiatives.
As we work to minimize our impact on the planet, we can also provide positive benefits to the local environment as well as neighboring communities.
A “Positive Performance” methodology measures the performance of a local ecosystem to establish science-based aspirational targets.
If we can operate our sites to meet or exceed our local ecosystem performance, we consider that to be positive.
Measurements of an ecosystem can include carbon capture rates, water infiltration volume, biodiversity support, soil generation, etc.
The process also identifies design strategies that can help close the performance gap between the local ecosystem and the site.
Strategies can include nature inspired solutions.
Supply Chain Biodiversity We expect our suppliers to preserve biodiversity as well.
Revisions to the “Automotive Industry Guiding Principles to Enhance Sustainability Performance in the Supply Chain” include sections on biodiversity, land use and deforestation.

We are leveraging them to forge a path to our future as we strive for excellence in all we do, shift our focus to the most important work, and collaborate on our most difficult shared challenges.
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT Employee engagement is the thread that weaves throughout the company as we transform our business to meet our electric future.
It is a catalyst for our success.
A multi-channel open dialogue keeps our employees informed, engaged and vested in the company’s success.
Our regular cadence of communications includes monthly global Town Halls, our intranet and websites, corporate publications and reports, social media, webcasts and executive Q&A sessions with senior management, labor-management committee meetings and Employee Resource Group (ERG) initiatives.
Together they provide opportunities to frequently share information and business updates.
Understanding our employees’ concerns is also critical.
Regular employee sentiment polls enable us to keep our finger on the pulse of employee engagement, identify trends and take action as needed.
For example, in 2022, 82% of respondents reported feeling like they belong at Ford and can be themselves.
Also, 82% of respondents reported that leadership shows diversity is important through its actions.
Many of our employees are passionate about social issues.
Ford’s Social Action Council is a cross-functional team of Ford leaders that assesses social issues for impact and relevance to Ford’s business and stakeholders.
The Social Action Council applies a consistent decision-making framework to develop and present engagement recommendations to the Company’s executive leaders and Board of Directors based on Ford’s purpose, business and capacity to make an impact.
Employee Resource Groups Sponsored by our senior leaders and open to all employees, for more than 40 years ERGs have provided support, outreach, mentoring, and development to all employees.
Our ERGs continue to positively impact the business as they host a range of professional, educational, and cultural events as well as supporting our diversity-related efforts in recruitment and community outreach.
For example, Ford Empowering Diverse Abilities (FEDA) ERG is working with leadership on strategic planning around accessibility.

Our learning opportunities are now more accessible, and we offer a self-guided learning experience platform that further enables employees to take ownership of their professional development.
LEARNING STRATEGIES Our learning strategy is designed to prepare Ford for today and the future and focuses on four key actions: • Socialize learning, enabling every employee to be a learner and a teacher • Create skill-based academies to accelerate critical skill development • Modernize our learning approaches, to reinforce lifelong learning, and enable people to learn anytime and anywhere • Introduce tools that know when to nudge learners, track progress, and acknowledge their achievements We continue to evolve our learning strategy to address the new ways employees are working – onsite, remote and hybrid – offering learning options that fit each model.
We are also modernizing our learning design and tools beyond traditional class-based approaches to embrace social learning and learning that is “bite-size” and in the flow of work.
To align with how employees learn and connect outside of work, we are building platforms that feel more like YouTube and other familiar social media platforms.
Workforce development is a key consideration for the Michigan Central Project, FARIC and several other educational projects throughout the company.
We will continue to work closely with the Ford Fund and the Workforce Team in Manufacturing.
Inclusive Leadership Globally, we continue to encourage all People Leaders to become certified Inclusive Leaders.
The goal of the Inclusive Leader Certification Experience is to enable all leaders to cultivate inclusion and build better teams.
Certification is achieved through a blended learning approach.
Participants will reflect on their inclusive leadership and establish personal goals, learn about inclusive leadership and leverage feedback and learnings to help them shift the way they lead to become even more inclusive.
In North America, all People Leaders are encouraged to participate in Men as Allies workshops.
This live, facilitator-led virtual workshop focuses on empowering participants to take practical approaches and actions toward male allyship and gender equity.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Today’s workforce values flexibility and we are committed to meeting our employees’ needs while balancing the needs of the business.
At Ford, the purpose of work defines where that work is done.
We take a consistent approach to flexible work patterns and arrangements globally.

The confidential sessions provide a safe space for employees to have courageous conversations about their experience at Ford.
The sessions are intended to build empathy, deepen understanding of the employee experience, and spark changes to behaviors and policies that will lead to a more equitable workplace.
These sessions provide valuable insight into universal themes across groups, and well as themes unique to specific demographics.
Our Day of Understanding Listening Session series provided employees from an affinity group the opportunity to share their Ford experience with one senior leader and one host in a small group setting.
The leader’s role is to practice empathetic listening to gain insights in the lived experiences of a demographic different from their own.
Listening, Learning, Celebrating A robust slate of programs and events in 2022 brought Ford employees together to listen to each other, hear different perspectives and celebrate our differences – and our commonalities.
Our DEI learning strategy includes: • Learning workshops to foster male allyship, leadership training specifically designed to address the needs of women in the workplace, Racial Equity Interactive Series and a variety of DEI related online learning content • Employee recognition including the Global DEI Art Challenge and Global DEI Awards • Experiential events including International Women’s Day Celebration, Day of Understanding, Global DEI Week and Chinese Lunar New Year Celebration JUNETEENTH Ford continues to honor Juneteenth as a day of celebration that recognizes freedom for all Americans.
As we celebrated Juneteenth 2022, our U.S. employees demonstrated our commitment to learning and caring for each other by participating in guided discussions with their team and expressing solidarity by wearing the colors of the Juneteenth flag.
Measuring Progress At Ford, we work to celebrate our differences and create an environment where our diverse team members feel like they belong.
And we hold ourselves accountable.
In 2021, each corporate officer had a DEI objective, and in 2022 this was expanded to all salaried employees globally.
Since we created aspirational goals in 2020 to increase representation of global women and U.S. minorities at the senior leader level and above, we have made progress year over year.
We are seeing more diversity in senior leadership roles in hiring and retention.
For the fifth consecutive year, Ford has been recognized as a leader by Bloomberg Gender Equality Index (GEI) for continuous progress in gender representation amongst other categories impacting women.
We are proud that by taking focused actions, we improved our leadership and talent category score in GEI by over 20% from 2021.
The need to have complete, accurate, and current global data about our workforce is critical to informing benefits planning as well as ensuring we build equity into our systems, processes, and policies.
With that in mind, we are introducing a voluntary company-wide Self-ID Initiative designed to gather more complete and updated employee demographic information.
New options are available including gender identity beyond binary male/ female, sexual orientation, personal pronouns and in the U.S. the addition of Middle Eastern/North African/Arab American race.
Human Capital and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Equal Employment Opportunity Our EEO-1 report provides a snapshot of our U.S. demographics as of year-end 2022, based on occupational categories prescribed by the federal government that aggregate jobs with widely varying skill requirements.
Approximately 95% of all Ford Motor Company hourly and salaried positions fall into just four of the 10 categories.
The usefulness of this data for measuring diversity success, and for making direct comparisons to other companies or other industries with different job structures, is therefore extremely limited.
To address these shortcomings, Ford has developed a more robust supplemental report that disaggregates technical jobs in fields such as engineering and information technology, which pose recruiting challenges that are very distinct from non-technical roles.
The supplemental report also provides more nuanced breakdowns of diversity at various managerial levels.
We are committed to equal pay for equal work.
Employee compensation in each market should be fair and equitable, irrespective of gender, race, or similar personal characteristics.
Equal pay for equal work applies to all forms of pay, including base salary, incentives, bonuses, and other forms of compensation.
In 2022, we cascaded 68 Affirmative Action Plans in the U.S. for all manufacturing locations and skill teams to develop action plans.
u READ MORE IN THE EEO-1 REPORT AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT Global DEI Efforts The Global DEI Office aligns with our regional DEI leads to ensure the corporate DEI strategy is implemented and revised, if needed, in the regions to meet the needs of our colleagues across the globe.
Our intentional method allows our global markets to ensure inclusivity for all teammates and provides a more catered approach to the tools and resources needed to create a sense of inclusion for all.
For example, our Hermosillo Assembly Plant Walking the DEI Path Team organized a multidisciplinary team to ensure people with disabilities were added to our workforce, integrating people with motor and hearing disabilities within the recruitment process, and organizing Mexican Sign Language and awareness workshops.
In 2022, Ford of Europe has focused on increasing awareness, engagement and transparency around DEI at all levels.
We launched our first ever DEI Hub for employees for learning and discussion; published a DEI People Leader Playbook and Gender DEI Analytics Dashboard; amplified and celebrated our ERGs through events; and provided a safe space for employees to share their lived experiences with our senior leaders through Listening sessions.
Through our #ToughTalks and “Very Gay Raptor” campaign we tackled issues related to the LGBTQ+ community.
We also created several campaigns to support Women of Ford and launched the JobShare Connect application to support our DEI and flexible work culture.
Ford South America is demonstrating its commitment to diversity through succession planning, leadership development, recruitment, pay equity, and external agreements.
Internally in South America, women represent 70% of our leadership position succession planning; and to accelerate leadership development, 60 women participated in job shadowing programs in 2022.
As we recruit new talent, Ford South America is increasing our diverse talent pipeline; 65% of new hires in South America were diverse candidates.
We are also working to ensure compensation equity between genders and are able to sustain above 90% in all levels.
We have signed five external agreements and commitments that reinforce our commitment to diversity.

It’s important that our dealerships are inclusive of everyone in the communities they serve.
By employing people of different backgrounds and perspectives, dealers can create a space where every customer feels welcomed and is treated with dignity and respect.
To help incorporate inclusivity into their operations and help their employees build cultural competence, dealers are encouraged to attend Ford Guest Experience (FGE) Immersion.
FGE includes a DEI breakout session where dealers work with their peers to share and brainstorm ways in which they can integrate DEI concepts into their dealership culture.
FGE participants are implementing ideas such as inviting employees from throughout the dealership to provide feedback and share different perspectives at leadership meetings and expanding their recruiting practices to include more diverse applicants.
Developing the next generation of talent is also a focus for our dealers.
Our new Sponsor Our Students program works with dealers to offer opportunities for students interested in meaningful careers as automotive technicians.
In 2022, more than 1,000 Ford and Lincoln dealers offered 3,600+ students a unique opportunity for work-based learning within their service department, including the support of a mentor.
Supplier Diversity and Inclusion Supporting and developing a diverse supply chain contributes to strong and sustainable businesses.
Through our advocacy and relationship building efforts internally and externally, we are making a positive impact on our bottom line and within the communities where our suppliers operate.
In 2022, we sourced $10.78 billion in goods and services with diverseowned businesses.
We are working to further expand our spend by including diverse supplier sourcing and development metrics into our corporate scorecards and dashboards.
In addition, we are incorporating small and diverse businesses into our sourcing plan for Ford’s $11.4 billion BlueOval City and Blue Oval SK development projects in Tennessee and Kentucky.
These factories will enhance Ford’s EV vehicle and battery production and provide sourcing opportunities for several diverse suppliers.
Rapidly changing technologies are creating incredible opportunities for growth with diverse suppliers who are able to identify and understand the traditional industry disruptors, grasp the concept of Diversity & Inclusion and develop a forward-looking strategy and plan.
We remain committed to support, develop, grow and promote our diverse suppliers through programs including Widening the Inclusion Network, Ford/Great Lakes Women’s Business Council, MentorWE, Michigan Minority Supplier Development Council’s (MMSDC) Collaborative Growth Initiative, Ford specific Black Supplier Development Program, and MMSDC UniTier Reporting.
We also help form strategic alliances and joint ventures between diverse and non-diverse suppliers that enable diverse business owners to grow and develop.
Diverse suppliers not only increase capacity in areas of expertise, but also acquire new technical and manufacturing capabilities.
We intend to continue this practice as we embrace our future of mobility and connected vehicles.

u READ MORE ABOUT OUR PROGRESS ON THIS SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE IN OUR HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS REPORT That’s why we are dedicated to ensuring the physical safety and mental health and wellbeing of our employees, which, in turn, has a direct impact on their happiness, comfort and morale.
Embracing and advancing a culture of awareness, education and training also helps contribute to an engaged and motivated workforce.
Many of our internal standards go beyond applicable laws and regulations to meet our commitment to our global workforce.
The safety, health, and wellbeing of our people comes first in our day-to-day operations.
Not only is it fundamental to our purpose, but it also makes good business sense.
ENSURING A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT Promoting safety, health and wellbeing permeates our culture and cascades through the organization.
Employees at every level of the company are responsible for the company’s overall safety initiatives and performance.
Our Code of Conduct provides the framework for our safety efforts and holds us accountable as it calls upon all employees to: • Take personal responsibility for knowing and following the safety guidelines that apply to their roles and locations • Take health and safety training seriously, and follow all safety-related policies and procedures • Practice safe driving habits • Never work or drive while impaired by drugs or alcohol • Understand that illegal drugs, controlled substances, and unauthorized alcohol have no place at work All Ford team members are expected to participate in all required safety training, understand and follow our policies, processes, and requirements; wear or use all required personal protective equipment; never take shortcuts or avoid required safety practices; and speak up immediately if they see unsafe behavior or hazardous conditions.
When it comes to personal health, practicing self-care is important.
We encourage our employees to understand that when they are not well, it is sometimes better to stay home and avoid infecting others.
Occupational Health and Safety Our Health and Safety Commitment, “Our most valuable asset is our people.
There can be no compromise” forms the basis of our safety culture.
It applies to all employees, contractors, and visitors performing work at our locations globally.
Safety performance is managed by Senior Leadership through Plant Operation Reviews (POR), Manufacturing Safety Councils (MSC), and Safety Process Review Board meetings (SPRB).
Unions representing production workers, skilled trades, and engineers play a crucial role in improving health and safety for our employees and workplaces.
We are committed to supporting these unions and collective bargaining to ensure the health and safety of our union represented employees and locations.
Designated members of management interact with local, national, and global union representatives to foster the open communications and collaboration needed to work through contractual requirements.
We provide UAW involvement in the facility Safety Operating System (SOS) self-assessment and continue to address issues as they arise.
Together with robust standards and procedures, dedicated resources in our manufacturing engineering teams assure safe conditions and a safe workplace at every Ford facility.
Our engineered systems are designed and installed to provide safe operations for our employees.
As we build new plants and update existing facilities, safety for highrisk construction contractors working on Ford projects is also a priority.
In addition to our standard safety procedures, we held our Annual Construction Contractor Safety Summit in May 2022, with a focus on injury prevention and other topics important to our contractors.
More than 45 construction companies participated.

The Battery Electric Safety Core Team continues to share knowledge with engineering, product development and manufacturing locations.
This team reviews training requirements, emergency response procedures, best practices, and internal and external incidents to better understand and prepare our workforce.
Our medical and Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology teams are supporting new processes globally and reviewing new materials that will be used in the processes for manufacturing battery electric vehicles globally, to ensure that we anticipate, identify, analyze and measure potential occupational exposures and monitor our employees as needed.
 FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 71 | | | | | | | PROACTIVE APPROACH TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE In order to respond to natural disasters and other emergency situations, it’s imperative to have a comprehensive plan in place – and test it.
In 2022, we enacted an emergency response drill that simulated an F1 tornado hitting our transmission plant in Sharonville, Ohio.
Our emergency response team (ERT) members took caring for each other to the next level as they coordinated with municipal agencies for the drill.
The drill was documented and reviewed to evaluate our ERT’s readiness, effectiveness and skill sets when addressing a variety of emergency scenarios.
Our team will use this information to continuously improve our emergency response strategies.
Safety Operating System Our Safety Operating System (SOS) helps to ensure the work environment within our facilities is safe for our employees and meets or exceeds all regulatory and Company requirements.
This internal tool validates each global manufacturing facility’s capability and adherence to meet our safety requirements.
The SOS is designed to prevent and reduce incidents through the implementation of different elements such as incident investigation and analysis, training, risk assessment and emergency preparedness.
We utilize the SOS to continuously monitor and improve workplace safety.
Safety performance is measured with leading and lagging indicators.
The leading indicator, Global Corrective Action Completion Percentage, ensures that items are completed in a timely manner to prevent recurrence of a similar event.
The lagging indicator is Global Lost-Time Case Rate.
In 2022, our Global Lost-Time Case Rate was 0.39.
In 2021, the SOS was integrated with an SOS dashboard created by our Global Data Insight and Analytics (GDIA) team which provides global, regional, manufacturing director, and plant specific self-assessment results.
This tool has simplified data review by allowing us to quickly identify issues by location, region, or globally to ensure allocation of resources.
The SOS operates in conjunction with the Safe Observation Index, which ensures our employees are working safely, and Pre-Task Analysis, which identifies work hazards and mitigation techniques.
We continue to utilize the Global Event Reporting Tool (GERT), which enables us to quickly notify locations of a significant event which may affect their operations.
Together with the Corrective Action Issuance process, it provides a forum for Ford to communicate significant incidents when they occur, and then proactively provide instruction and guidance to our facilities through Immediate Corrective Actions and Permanent Corrective Actions.
These corrective actions require facilities to make changes and improvements, and implement controls to prevent reccurrence of these significant incidents.
In Mexico, we are evaluating an internally developed safety process to further advance the SOS system.
The Ford Mexico Safety 4.0 modernization strategy embraces technology to comply with SOS procedures and regulatory requirements as it tracks safety metrics.
Safety Training As we work to achieve a future that is free from workplace injuries, safety training plays an essential role.
Our safety training programs are best in class in the automotive industry.
Our safety training matrix lists all safety topics, the frequency for each training course, the personnel that are required to complete training, and who manages the training and training format.
In 2022, we streamlined the Job Safety Analysis instruction process to improve operator knowledge of workstation hazards.
We conducted regular communications and promotions on key safety issues to promote occupational health and safety.
We also shared safety best practices via multi-industry groups, within and outside the automotive sector, and collaborated to address common issues.
COVID-19 Response Our medical team continues to work with Safety, HR, and Labor Affairs to ensure that we adapt and revise our processes and policies as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic changes with time.
During 2022, we removed many restrictions in most locations globally while maintaining compliance with local and national requirements, resulting in the transition of nonplace-dependent team members to onsite or hybrid work.
In this way, we supported Ford’s evolution of work while maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all team members.
As the global situation evolves, we are supporting our team members in real time, to ensure their wellbeing and continued access to updated medical information.
Our Safety Record Our focus on identifying potentially fatal events and high-potential incidents involving our employees and contractors globally continues.
When these incidents do occur, global corrective actions are initiated and tracked to ensure that the identified causal factors are addressed.
These corrective actions are tracked weekly to ensure timely completion.
Our safety efforts have reduced these types of events.
However, in 2022 we did experience two fatalities – both in our joint venture operations.
Each loss of life is unacceptable.
Consequently, cross-functional teams worked extensively to identify and implement controls to prevent recurrence of fatal hazards.
Employee Health, Safety and Wellbeing – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES The interaction between wellbeing and employee engagement is a powerful one.
Holistically healthy employees are typically more likely to be happy and productive and more likely to remain with a company.
That’s why we are building employee engagement by providing relevant, timely and holistic wellbeing resources.
 FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 72 | | | | | | | Human Centered Design for Health, Safety and Wellness Human-centered design can transform the auto industry’s approach to manufacturing.
We have leveraged past learnings and conducted new research to formulate the following five key priorities to address the occupational demands specific to manufacturing.
Health Equity Everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible.
Learning and Growth Encourage exploration and development of soft skills and lifelong learning.
Engagement and Choice Empower choice of how to work, rest and play when possible and appropriate.
Culture and Understanding Advocate work-life integration and understanding of individual differences.
Environmental Impact Align our operations to our organizational values.
Through these priorities we aim to improve the working conditions and health of our essential workers.
By focusing on environmental stewardship and social equity, we can lead the transformation of the industry’s approach to manufacturing.
WELLBEING The interaction between wellbeing and employee engagement is a powerful one.
Holistically healthy employees are typically more likely to be satisfied with their job, more productive and more likely to remain with a company.
That’s why we are building employee engagement by providing relevant, timely and holistic wellbeing resources.
We remain committed to advancing a culture of wellbeing, which encompasses the financial, social, mental, emotional, physical, and professional needs of our employees.
We understand that in order to stay Ford Tough it is imperative that we provide our employees with the benefits, resources and support that addresses their lives both at and away from work.
For example, Ford Middle East held a Warrior in Pink campaign to raise awareness of breast cancer for employees via a video in collaboration with Mais Mohammad, a breast cancer survivor, life coach and motivational speaker, and her oncologist.
The video discussed the importance of early detection of breast cancer along with the best ways for regular testing and self-checkup.
After it was posted on the Instagram channels of Mais and Ford, the video had 10,000 views and 100% positive sentiment.
There is a relationship between psychological safety and wellbeing.
We are focused on creating and maintaining an environment where our employees feel safe enough to share their voices.
In 2022, the DEI Office hosted wellbeing sessions in response to real-time social issues such as the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Today more than ever, individuals are struggling to balance the increased complexities of personal and work life.
As a result, Ford ensures that our programs, policies and employment practices recognize the diverse needs of all our employees, allowing them to contribute their maximum effort at work while at the same time fulfilling their personal and family responsibilities.
For example, our Total Health Program provides short-term professional counseling and referral services to employees and dependent family members.
This voluntary and confidential service is free of charge and is available 24 hours a day/7 days a week, 365 days a year.
In addition to our core wellbeing offerings in 2022 we expanded or added programs, benefits and resources to improve employee wellbeing.
• We expanded the flexible family care policy to enable our employees to attend their own or immediate family member’s healthcare and wellbeing appointments.
• We developed a Caring for Teams workbook for People Leaders to assist with wellbeing check ins and help employees overcome uncertainties and manage change.
• We developed a Wellbeing Ambassadors group which includes employees from a variety of skill teams that will help build the culture of wellbeing at Ford.
Employee Health, Safety and Wellbeing – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES We have continued to emphasize the importance of mental health through initiatives like monthly webinars from the National Council for Mental Wellbeing, and special events during Mental Health Awareness Month, Global Suicide Prevention Awareness Day and World Mental Health Day.
September marked the third Annual Mindfulness Week, which presented new and innovative ways for colleagues to create calm and renewed focus in their daily lives.
Senior leadership has also participated in sharing the importance of breaking mental health stigma as well as their personal struggles and strategies that helped them.
More than 400 Ford employees across the globe are bringing the concept of caring for each other to life as Mental Health First Aiders, acting as a first point of contact for fellow employees seeking support and/or information for concerns such as stress, anxiety or depression.
To bring awareness to the topic of burnout, we created a global infographic and curated additional resources to help employees and People leaders understand the signs and symptoms, as well as ways to prevent and resolve burnout.
EMPLOYEE SENTIMENT We leverage our ask/listen/observe framework to understand employee sentiment at Ford.
This holistic and consistent methodology enables us to understand how employees are feeling in real time and act accordingly.
Our measurement focuses on several areas that are key to our business: • Employee Mental and Emotional Wellbeing • Health & Safety • Employee Experience, Culture, DEI, Leadership, and Strategic Alignment Our efforts to drive change in these areas are paying off.
For example, we began surveying our employees about their work-life balance at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In 2022, 90% of the respondents, who were primarily salaried employees, indicated that they are empowered to have the work arrangement they believe is best for their jobs.
Additionally, 86% of respondents indicated all people on their team feel valued, respected, and heard regardless of differences and 87% indicated their people leader provides the safety needed to openly share their opinion.
Ensuring that data ends up in the hands of those who are best positioned to drive meaningful change is a critical element of our measurement program.
To this end, leaders at all levels have access to dashboards with data from their teams and organizations, as well as personalized next step recommendations embedded into action planning tools.
Our measurement approach is also used to inform our areas of focus as an organization and to evaluate the effectiveness of talent initiatives across the enterprise.
We are undertaking several efforts in 2023 to continue evolving this program, including rotating questions in our always-on survey and incorporating new metrics to ensure we are learning from employees.
As we expand our footprint of wellbeing efforts, we continue to apply data analytics to understand employee needs and the impact of Ford’s wellbeing programs and how these insights can help prioritize Ford’s wellbeing efforts and drive positive outcomes.
Today more than ever, individuals are struggling to balance the increased complexities of personal and work life.
As a result, Ford ensures that our programs, policies and employment practices recognize the diverse needs of all our employees, allowing them to contribute their maximum effort at work while at the same time fulfilling their personal and family responsibilities.

Our Vice President, Chief Sustainability, Environment and Safety Officer is responsible for interpreting and implementing this policy, managing risk, and reviewing with, as appropriate, the Vice President Global Manufacturing and Labor Affairs, Vice President Global Commodity Purchasing, Chief People and Employee Experience Officer, and the Chief Policy Officer and General Counsel.
The Global Sustainability and Purchasing Supply Chain Sustainability teams are responsible for day-to-day operations of human rights and environment leadership, management and implementation.
A cross-functional team has been developed to review and determine how Ford will comply with new and upcoming due diligence laws.
The internal team has also identified opportunities to be transparent about the human rights risks to Ford.
HUMAN RIGHTS RISK ASSESSMENT In our We are Committed to Protecting Human Rights and the Environment policy, we commit to conducting due diligence and providing grievance mechanisms and remedy aligned with the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights.
We assess risk, engage with various stakeholders, conduct training, and perform audits.
In line with this policy, Ford conducts human rights risk assessments across its global manufacturing facilities.
Since 2020, Ford has used the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Online Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for a more quantitative assessment of potential human rights risk and a consistent process to analyze responses.
In 2022, 35 Ford facilities conducted self-assessments bringing the total of completed questionnaires to 109 since 2004.
Assessment results show these facilities have low human rights risk, consistent with the previous year’s results.
We will continue to evaluate and improve our processes for expanded rollout to additional facilities, furthering our efforts to ensure the protection of human rights and basic working conditions within our global manufacturing facilities.
We are ensuring our compliance with Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act by conducting a saliency assessment with additional risk analysis of our operations including supply chain and are updating our processes for managing and addressing risks and closing gaps in our procedures.
Ford is taking a leadership approach by implementing these due diligence actions globally throughout the company.

It is important that we not only think about how Ford can use our purchasing power to fuel our business needs, but also to advance sustainability.” MARY WROTEN, DIRECTOR, GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY & ESG FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Human Rights and Supply Chain Management – continued HUMAN RIGHTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN Ford is dedicated to respecting human rights everywhere we operate and throughout our supply chain.
With more than 1,600 Tier 1 production suppliers providing vehicle parts composed of nearly 1,000 different materials, we recognize the complexity of our supply chain.
Nonetheless we remain committed to understanding where materials come from and using materials in our vehicles that are safe and sourced responsibly.
Ford continues to work closely with our suppliers and with third-party assurers such as trusted partners like the Initiative for Responsible Mining (IRMA), Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), to identify and immediately address human rights issues in our supply chain against comprehensive social and environmental criteria outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct.
We help our suppliers build their capacity to manage supply chain issues through training resources.
We meet with our top suppliers individually to discuss specific sustainability topics on an annual basis.
Supplier Code of Conduct We aim to ensure that everything we make – or that others make for us – not only complies with local laws but follows our commitment to sustainability and human rights protection.
Members of Ford’s global supplier community are required to comply with Ford’s Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) as part of our Global Terms and Conditions.
Launched in 2021, the Supplier Code outlines our requirements and expectations for supplier relationships including the protection of human rights and the environment, the responsible sourcing of materials, responsible and lawful business practices, and the associated implementation of these principles.
The Supplier Code extends beyond our Tier 1 suppliers and cascades through the supply chain.
It mandates that Ford suppliers enforce a similar code of practice and requires that subcontractors do the same.
In order to increase compliance, we are providing training to help suppliers update their policies to align with the Supplier Code.
u READ MORE IN THE SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT Assessing and Auditing our Supply Chain As we work to extend compliance with legislation, we are broadening our scope to include all 4,600 Tier 1 supplier sites to ensure compliance with the Supplier Code.
Using the industry standard Drive Sustainability Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), we analyze our suppliers’ policies to ensure they are aligned with ours.
Armed with this information, our sourcing decisions now include results from the SAQ and suppliers’ willingness to work with us on compliance through our sourcing process.
Third-party sustainability audits let suppliers know whether they meet their contractual obligations to Ford and our expectations while highlighting areas for improvement.
As a member of the RBA, we use its Validated Audit Protocol (VAP) to assess labor, health and safety, management systems, ethics and environmental issues in our supply chain.
In Europe, Ford is one of the 14 founding members of the Responsible Supply Chain Initiative (RSCI) launched by the German Automotive Industry Association VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie).
The objective of the RSCI is to develop a standardized assessment for evaluating the sustainability of companies in automotive supply chains, including social compliance of working conditions, occupational safety and environmental protection.
RSCI has also launched an industry standard audit, which is aligned with the requirements of Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act.
We piloted this audit in 2022 and will expand our use of it in 2023.
We provide our suppliers with tools and training from the RBA to support their continual improvement if gaps are identified from their audits or SAQ responses.
We also provide training locally to our suppliers based in countries with higher risk of forced labor, to ensure they recruit ethically.
u READ MORE IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS REPORT WORKER VOICE APP In 2022, we launched the new RBA Worker Voice Platform to our suppliers.
Developed by the RBA, the platform gives workers more ways to provide feedback and learn important professional and personal skills, as well as a place to air grievances.
Features of the RBA Worker Voice Platform include: • Feedback Reporting – Provides a simple reporting method for workers via QR codes, mobile phones, or website • Worker Survey Tool – Easily deploys customizable surveys to thousands of workers across multiple suppliers and/or facilities in our supply chain • Audit Support – Allows for worker interviews to be performed discreetly, without supervisor oversight, and enables workers to report retaliation against audit participants • Mobile Learning App – More than 400 courses in multiple languages are available on a range of subjects, including health and safety, career development, and personal growth We offered use of this app free to charge to all our direct suppliers in 2022, and will continue to encourage adoption by suppliers in 2023.
We also introduced the app’s grievance mechanism on our corporate website to enable its use for any member of the community to learn and provide feedback.
FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 76 | | | | | | | Human Rights and Supply Chain Management – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY Supply chain transparency and human rights protection go hand in hand.
When potential supplier issues are identified anywhere in our supply chain, we initiate an investigation to determine whether the supplier is in the supply chain providing parts to Ford.
If confirmed, we then work with our Tier 1 supplier to cascade our requirements and confirm compliance with our Supplier Code.
We are currently developing internal systems to conduct these investigations proactively with suppliers in our highest risk categories.
By improving our visibility into our supply chain, we are enabling better business practices and supply chain resiliency, starting from raw materials and their responsible sourcing.
Not only does this help us identify and address human rights risks, it also positions us to comply with due diligence legislation.
RESPONSIBLE SOURCING OF RAW MATERIALS Ford uses our purchasing power to not only fuel our business needs but also protect communities and the environment on which they depend.
Our goal is to understand the origins of our raw material and ensure it is sourced responsibly, upholding our commitment to human rights, compliance with international standards, and minimizing environmental and community impact.
It is imperative that we have sufficient raw materials to achieve our goals for electric vehicles.
To do so, we are moving quickly to identify and negotiate with raw material suppliers to secure materials that meet our ESG requirements.
We have implemented processes and structural changes to enable fast action.
We are working diligently to ensure we are ethically sourcing and tracing the value chains and the raw materials that move through them.
We are making sourcing decisions that align with our sustainability standards and corporate sustainability commitments.
CATENA-X In an effort to increase the transparency of our supply chain, we have engaged with the Catena-X Automotive Network, which was established to improve sustainability and efficiency across the automotive supply chain through continuous data exchange between partners.
As a digital ecosystem and collaborative network, Catena-X will create uniform standards for data and information exchange across the automotive value chain.
Ford joins a wide range of partners from business and science in this unprecedented collaboration between companies in the automotive industry.
The areas of application include quality management, maintenance, supply chain management and sustainability.
The smooth flow of data between members and their global partners could improve issue management in case of supply chain pressures, raw materials shortages, and parts tracking and address issues quickly.
Ford’s involvement with Catena-X will help the company improve sustainability, ensure human rights standards are followed and make supply chains even more transparent.
Conflict Minerals Due Diligence Since 2013, in compliance with the U.S. Dodd Frank Act, section 1502, we have filed an annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The report describes our due diligence process, as defined by the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to ensure suppliers who provide us with components containing tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (3TG) understand the origins of such minerals, source them responsibly, and not knowingly provide parts containing minerals that contribute to conflict.
Suppliers are required to use smelters and refiners that have been validated as conforming to an independent third-party responsible mineral sourcing validation program.

Post-Crash Response Not only can our SYNC in-car connectivity help occupants call for assistance after an accident, but it can also give first responders potentially life-saving information, quickly and efficiently.
SYNC in-car connectivity provides the operator with a GPS location and relays data on impact velocity, crash type, safety belt use, and airbag deployment, helping emergency services respond appropriately.
The majority of our vehicles also carry the SOS Post-Crash Alert System™, which alerts passers-by and first responders to a vehicle’s location.
Keeping Customers Safe and Satisfied Customer satisfaction is an important part of our safety efforts.
We are expanding the use of connected vehicle data to identify potential emerging issues as well as to help us understand what customers may be experiencing.
Keeping Pedestrians and Cyclists Safe Ford is researching a new smartphone-based communications technology that could potentially help warn drivers of pedestrians, bicyclists and more – even those approaching a vehicle’s path but blocked from a driver’s view.
The concept smartphone app for pedestrians and others can communicate potential risks to connected Ford vehicles with SYNC providing in-vehicle screen alerts, complementing other technologies such as Ford Co-Pilot 36025 advanced driver assistance systems.
Ford is researching the technology with Commsignia, PSS, Ohio State University, T-Mobile and Tome Software.
EV Battery Health and Safety Ensuring the safety and quality of EV batteries is crucial to building trust in our fleet of electric vehicles.
Every Ford EV includes a battery quality operating system.
Quality checks and tight process controls are integrated throughout the battery cell manufacturing and battery pack screening during vehicle assembly.
Once a vehicle is built, Ford leverages cloud-based vehicle monitoring and detection and can communicate with connected customers if a voltage anomaly is detected.
Ford also provides High Voltage safety publications including a Workshop Manual for vehicle technicians and an Emergency Responders Guide for first responders.
Ford EVs are subjected to crash testing that far exceeds the stringency of regulatory requirements.
For example, we conduct front, side and rear impact crash tests at 5mph above the speeds required by safety regulations, which translates to increased impact severities ranging from 20-35% as compared to what is required by law.
We also conduct crash tests that are not even required by regulations, furthering the high level of safety of our EVs.
Ford is involved in pre-competitive research related to EV and battery safety such as Li-ion Multiphysics Modeling, Post Crash HV/LV Components and Connectors and Intrusion Effects on HV Batteries.

IMPROVING OUR QUALITY PROCESSES We are committed to improving our quality processes.
We continue to invest additional time and attention to improving vehicle quality and customer safety.
We are striving to ensure quality, customer satisfaction, and recall actions have more visibility and support at all levels of the company.
We are increasing our use of advanced data analytics and machine learning to help with the earlier detection of potential issues across our vehicle portfolio, even before delivering the vehicle to the customer.
Our Early Quality Issue Suite draws on multiple data sources, from connected vehicles to customer service calls, to accelerate the investigative process.
This tool minimizes time from detection to correction by combining this information with automatic anomaly detection and root cause analysis.
Machine learning tools are now being utilized for expedited review of field reports to accelerate the detection of potential issues in the field.
Additionally, this capability is being further developed with the vision of automatically and continuously identifying potential issues with limited human intervention.
This will translate into faster analysis of the data to address customer concerns at a more accelerated pace.
We are expanding the numbers of parts and subsystems that we can precisely trace to vehicle-specific builds when an issue arises.
This avoids issuing wider recalls targeting a date range of vehicle identification numbers, which generally involve broad vehicle populations that may not all be affected.
By precisely identifying recall populations we can limit the number of customers who are inconvenienced and optimize the number of remedy parts needed.
Resolving issues quickly is important to our customers.
We measure time to issue resolution with a “shot clock” that leverages Quality Early Detection and uses over-the-air (OTA) update capability for faster issue resolution.
Connected vehicles give Ford the opportunity to update software OTA without requiring a customer to bring their vehicle to a dealership for repair.
With customer consent, Ford can address certain safety, environmental, and quality issues OTA.
The benefits of OTA software updates include speed of repair and improved completion rates, customer convenience (since no dealership visit is required), and lower cost for Ford, since dealerships do not need to be reimbursed for labor.
We continue to improve our integrated data management system for tracking investigations all the way through recall implementation.

Ford Fund partners with local leaders and nonprofits to understand and help meet unique needs in under-resourced and underrepresented communities.
FORD FUND MISSION: PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITIES TO MOVE PEOPLE FORWARD AND UPWARD Ford Motor Company Fund co-creates and invests in partnerships and programs across three impact areas: essential services, education for the future of work, and entrepreneurship.
Programming is designed to ensure people have equitable opportunities to progress and move forward.
Working across the enterprise, Ford Fund identifies opportunities to leverage the company’s scale, resources and mobility expertise to drive progress and make meaningful impact in communities through Ford Resource Centers, employee volunteerism and grantmaking.
In 2022, Ford and Ford Fund invested more than $64.3 million in charitable contributions to help strengthen communities and build a better world.
Since 1949, we have invested more than $2.2 billion in community-focused initiatives around the globe.
INNOVATING TO SUPPORT LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS Ford Resource and Engagement Centers are a Ford Fund innovation that bring nonprofits, residents and leaders together to increase access to food, essential services and community programming in under-resourced neighborhoods.
Since 2013, we have developed a global network of these facilities – each one unique in how it reflects the needs and culture of the community it serves.
At our resource centers in Detroit, we partner with nonprofits to deliver food and provide job placement, legal and financial services, and youth programming for residents.
Our location on Detroit’s East Side celebrated its fifth anniversary in 2022, and our southwest Detroit facility turns 10 in early 2023. u  DETROIT COMMUNITY CENTERS 2022 IMPACT 2.1M POUNDS OF FOOD DISTRIBUTED TO NEARLY 6 ,200 HOUSEHOLDS 664 JOBS PLACED THROUGH OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS 2,623 PEOPLE SERVED THROUGH LEGAL AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES 3,825 TAX RETURNS FILED THROUGH ACCOUNTING AID  FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 85 | | | | | | | Our center in Craiova Romania, which also celebrated its fifth anniversary in 2022, focuses on students and startups, serving as an incubator space for young people to create innovative solutions for job growth and economic opportunity.
Our Bangkok community center programming focuses on food delivery, environmental conservation, art and technology, and our center in Pretoria, South Africa focuses on entrepreneurship training to support economic growth.
VIEW A VIDEO ABOUT COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS MOBILIZING EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERS Every year, our employees demonstrate their commitment to building a better world by participating in the Ford Volunteer Corps – a global network of employees and retirees who volunteer their time in support of humanitarian efforts in Ford communities around the world.
In 2022, nearly 5,400 Ford employees spent over 50,000 hours volunteering in community service projects throughout the year.
During Global Caring Month in September, our annual month-long focus on community service, we awarded $895,000 in grants to 126 employee-nominated organizations in 30 countries.
Employees planned and participated in numerous community service projects throughout the month as well.
For example, in the U.K., volunteers worked with The Bike Project, a charity that takes in second-hand bikes, refurbishes them and donates them to those who need them.
In Romania, volunteers worked with an organization called Rotary Probitas Club to improve local school playgrounds.
And In South Africa, more than 200 volunteers lent their time and talent to 15 different projects.
In one of the projects, employees at Ford’s Struandale Plant worked with the Association for the Physically Disabled to create a sewing skills development center to teach women how to sew and help them start their own businesses.
Since 2005, Ford employees have logged more than 1.7 million volunteer hours in total – bringing unique skills, passion and teamwork to grassroots organizations and nonprofits across six continents.

I had a mentor who saw more in me than I saw in myself.
His only ask of me was for ‘each one to grab one,’ an African American proverb that refers to lifting others as we go.
So, when the Ford First Gen opportunity came up, I raised both hands.” PAM DUEROD, ATLANTA REGIONAL MANAGER FOR FORD CREDIT  STEPPING UP IN TIMES OF NEED When disaster strikes, Ford is ready with humanitarian aid.
Working with local nonprofits, dealers, aid organizations and our employee volunteer network, we donate funds, equipment and essential items to help meet urgent needs and support recovery and building efforts.
In 2022, Ford donated $2.3 million in disaster relief efforts.
These donations helped unlock access to critical resources for many communities, including those impacted by a mass shooting in Buffalo, NY and flooding in Kentucky.
When Hurricane Ian struck Florida in the fall of 2022, Ford activated a multi-pronged response that included a $1 million donation to various organizations on the ground, as well as assistance transporting people to Salvation Army pop-up shelters.
Ford also deployed and loaned F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid, F-150 Lightning trucks and Transit and E-Transit vans to help nonprofits power their relief efforts.
Ford and Ford Fund also provided much-needed humanitarian aid assistance to Ukraine.
Ford Fund provided $200,000 in relief funds, while Ford donated a fleet of 50 Ford Rangers and loaned another 25 vehicles to organizations supporting refugees and the movement of goods and people and their rescuers during the crisis.
Ford employees supported Ukrainians and host communities through various volunteer efforts.
Volunteers from across Europe provided a hotline and translation services for refugees, distributed food and care packages and supported nonprofits helping refugees in their local markets.
Ford Fund coordinated a massive humanitarian drive in the U.K. that resulted in more than 19.5 tons of in-kind donations including clothing, toiletries, batteries, sleeping bags, food and water, first-aid kits and more.
In several countries in the South American region, food insecurity has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
During 2021 and 2022, Ford distributed food and hygiene items to 10,000 families in vulnerable conditions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela.
INVESTING IN FUTURE GENERATIONS Since 2012, Ford Driving Dreams has been providing scholarship awards, contests and pep rallies to inspire youth and celebrate the benefits of staying in school, graduating on time and pursuing higher education.
In 2022, the program expanded to include a new pilot with Ford dealers in North Texas to fund auto technician scholarships.
Not only are we supporting students from under-resourced communities, but we are also addressing a key need for our industry by nurturing future talent.
Research shows that first-generation college students experience much higher dropout rates due to unique challenges they face as the first in their families to navigate college admissions, student life and financial aid.
Ford Fund’s First Gen program works to overcome this by pairing female Ford leaders with first-generation college students at the historically black college, Spelman College, providing an opportunity for students to have access to mentorship and an expanded network of opportunities and resources.

ROSE, CHIEF COMPLIANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY OFFICER AND ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 89 | | | | | | | FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Financial Risks Significant risk factors applicable to our business are outlined below.
OPERATIONAL RISKS Ford+ Our long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+, our plan for growth and value creation.
Ford+ is focused on delivering distinctive and increasingly electric products plus always-on customer relationships and user experiences.
Climate Change The risks and opportunities associated with climate change shape the way we do business, including our global carbon reduction strategy focused on reducing emissions from our vehicles, operations, and supply chain.
Extreme weather events such as storms, floods, wildfires, or prolonged periods of extreme temperature can disrupt production, component supplies, and freight and logistics operations, while droughts can affect our access to water for our operations, especially in water-scarce areas.
Additionally, climate-oriented regulations and initiatives may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived consumer benefit, dampening margins.
Public Health Issues Our financial condition and results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by public health issues, including the health impacts of climate change and epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19.
The impacts of public health issues, including changes in consumer behavior, market downturns, disruptions in supply chains, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has periodically created significant volatility in the global economy.
Disruption of our manufacturing operations could significantly impact our business.
Safety Recalls Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns.
Our vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs.
Reliance on Suppliers We depend on our complex global supply chain to deliver components and raw materials for our vehicles.
Our products contain components sourced from suppliers that, in turn, source components and raw materials from their suppliers.
A shortage of key components, such as the semiconductor shortage, or a lack of raw materials, such as those necessary for EV batteries, can disrupt our operations.
Raw Materials Exposure Our ability to produce EVs is dependent upon the availability of raw materials for batteries.
The demand and competition for such raw materials is increasing, and we may be unable to acquire sufficient amounts that are responsibly sourced, at reasonable prices, to meet our needs.
We are party to, and expect to continue to be party to, long-term contracts for the purchase of raw materials, which, subject to certain conditions, obligate us to purchase set amounts of materials, typically based on the market price at the time of delivery.
Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast.
Cybersecurity Risks As we develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity, operating and security systems are more at risk from potential disruptions.
We rely on information technology networks and systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices to process, transmit, and store vital data.
Despite data privacy and security measures, we are at risk of outages, cyberattacks, security breaches, or natural events, all of which could impact operational systems, compromise sensitive or personal information, or negatively affect the performance and safety of our vehicles.
Workforce Stability Our ongoing success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain a talented and diverse workforce that is highly skilled in engineering, software, technology, and other areas.
Global competition for such talent is intense, with potential employees increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose and strong brand reputation, flexible work arrangements, embracing sustainability and DEI initiatives.
The loss of existing employees or an inability to recruit new employees or reskill or upskill existing employees, particularly with the introduction of new technologies, could have an adverse effect on our business.
MACROECONOMIC, MARKET AND STRATEGIC RISKS Market Competition Our products and services are subject to market acceptance as well as competition from others in the automotive, digital and software services industries.
Although we conduct extensive market research before launching a vehicle or service, many factors within and outside our control can affect their success.
For example, a shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable ICE vehicles due to rising fuel prices, a decline in the construction industry, or government actions or incentives, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
Further, new offerings, including those related to EVs and autonomous driving technologies, may present technological challenges that could be costly to implement and overcome.
If the market for electrified vehicles or our services does not develop at the rate we expect or if consumers prefer our competitors’ vehicles or services, there could be an adverse effect on our business.
Geopolitics With our global footprint and the increasing interconnectedness of the global economy, a geopolitical crisis such as a war or changes to/withdrawals from existing trade agreements could have an immediate and material impact on our results.
Governments have considered applying tariffs on automobiles, parts, and other materials that could disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our business, affect demand for our products, and make Ford less competitive.
Further, our business could be impacted by governmental sanctions or export controls.
Inflation/Market Risk We and our suppliers are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.
Such risks cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases.
Significant changes in commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates, or other costs could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.
FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 90 | | | | | | | Financial Risks – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES FINANCIAL RISKS Market Disruption Our business is susceptible to credit rating downgrades, changes in interest rates, market volatility, market disruption, and regulatory requirements, which may impact our ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost.
Moreover, if these events occur, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints.
Rising interest rates in particular may impact Ford Credit’s ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin.
Government Incentives We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments around the world in the form of grants, loan subsidies, and tax abatements or credits.
These incentives encourage manufacturers to establish or increase investment, workforce, and/or production.
A decrease, expiration, or clawback of such incentives could impact our financial condition significantly.
Moreover, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides financial incentives to increase the domestic supply and consumer adoption of EVs.
Our ability to produce EVs that are eligible for IRA tax credits, and the availability of such credits for our customers, could significantly impact demand for our EVs, our financial condition, and results of operations.
Credit Ford Credit could experience higher credit losses, lower residual values, or higher return volumes for leased vehicles than expected.
Credit risk (the possibility of loss from a customer’s or dealer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms) is heavily dependent upon economic factors such as unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, and used car prices.
Pension and Other Post-retirement Plans The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits related to our pension and other post-retirement employee benefit plans requires us to use assumptions to estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants.
If actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may recognize a substantial remeasurement loss in our results.
In addition, if our cash flows and capital resources were insufficient to meet our post-retirement obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, or seek additional capital.
LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Litigation We spend substantial resources complying with safety, emissions, and other standards and regulations.
We cannot ensure, however, that employees or individuals affiliated with Ford will not violate these regulations.
Moreover, compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk, including the imposition of compensatory and punitive damages or injunctive relief.
Product Modifications The automotive industry is subject to safety, emissions, fuel economy, and other regulations that govern product characteristics, and these can differ regionally, nationally, or within a country.
New regulations are continuously being proposed to address environmental concerns (including those relating to global climate change and its impact), vehicle safety, and energy independence, and the regulatory landscape can change quickly.
To comply, we may need to substantially modify product plans.
ESG Disclosure The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) came into force in 2021, imposing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure and reporting requirements on financial services participants, including investment firms and fund managers.
The SFDR introduces disclosure obligations at both a firm and product level, requiring asset managers to disclose how sustainability risks are incorporated in their decision-making or outline the environmental or social benefits of certain products.

We are proud of that accomplishment – and we don’t take it for granted.
Our approach to ethics, integrity and transparency goes beyond compliance.
We lead with our values, and they permeate through all levels of our company.
We strive to act with transparency, integrity and honesty.
It’s the foundation of the trust we build with our employees, our customers and suppliers, our shareholders, and our communities.
We are committed to complying with existing laws, regulations and policies.
By providing clear policies, effective communication, and engaging training, we give our employees the tools they need to do the right thing.
As we look ahead, we are committed to maintaining and implementing state-of-the-art corporate governance policies and practices and ensuring they are reflective of current rules and regulations.
UPHOLDING THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF INTEGRITY It takes decades to become known for integrity.
We have been at it for 119 years – and we are not taking our foot off of the accelerator.
By providing appropriate training and communications tools, our Compliance, Ethics and Integrity Office ensures that our people are equipped to comply with legal obligations and policies that maintain the highest levels of integrity.
Regular and Open Communication Clear and open communication is a fundamental component of our corporate governance framework.
Ford outperforms our industry as we work to maintain open communication channels that include monthly reports on vehicle production, dealer inventory and retail sales.
This is in comparison to the quarterly reporting others in our industry conduct.
We believe that it’s important that we meet our customers where they are – and in many cases that’s on social media.
We use Ford Motor Company corporate accounts and Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley’s Twitter and LinkedIn accounts to share information on a regular basis.
ADHERING TO OUR CODE OF CONDUCT Employee Code of Conduct It’s important that our employees understand what is expected of them when it comes to business ethics and integrity.
Equally important is that our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders understand our standards and hold us accountable to them.
That’s how we live up to our reputation as a global leader in corporate ethics and social responsibility.
In 2021, we updated our Code of Conduct, simplified it, and made it more accessible.
We honed down 69 policies to 17 easy-to-understand commitments that include Ford’s We Are Committed to Protecting Human Rights and the Environment policy.
Our commitment to transparency is evident throughout the policy: its language is simpler and it clearly delineates what it means to work at and do business with Ford.
Available in 11 languages, our Code of Conduct covers important topics including human rights, the environment, privacy and lawful business practices – as well as information on how to report violations.
Supplier Code of Conduct Thousands of companies around the globe are involved in building Ford vehicles.
As the focus on human rights and climate change becomes sharper, it’s important that we hold our suppliers to the same high standards we require of ourselves.
In 2021, we launched our Supplier Code of Conduct to formalize the standards we’ll work with our suppliers to achieve.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct applies not only to the company’s Tier 1 suppliers, but cascades through the supply chain to their suppliers as well.
It is available in eight languages and is accessible on our corporate website to suppliers, our employees and the general public.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct mandates that our suppliers maintain responsible business practices.
Suppliers are required to protect and respect human rights, protect the environment and responsibly source materials.
The code also mandates that they conduct business free from bribery and corruption, maintain effective privacy and cyber-security practices and comply with applicable trade and customs rules.
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption We maintain the highest ethical standards wherever we operate.
With operations around the world, it’s important that our facilities comply with a wide range of national laws and governmental enforcement practices with regard to bribery and corruption, regardless of where they are located.
Bribery and corruption are forbidden, even in locations where they may be tolerated or condoned.
COMPLIANCE TRAINING Our robust and comprehensive compliance training supports our high standards of ethical conduct.
Mandatory online training courses for all Ford salaried full-time, part-time and agency workers, including an annual Code of Conduct course, ensure our policies are understood and reinforce their importance.
We periodically refresh and review the courses to keep the content relevant and appropriate.
REPORTING VIOLATIONS Our compliance program is designed to ensure that people can confidentially report known or potential violations of the law or of our policies.
Team members can report violations directly to Human Resources or the Compliance, Ethics and Integrity Office as well as the Office of the General Counsel.
Violations can also be reported using the SpeakUp reporting mechanism, telephone hotlines, websites, or email, some of which allow for anonymous reporting.
External stakeholders may report by emailing SpeakUp@ford.com.
A cross-functional committee reviews allegations and oversees any investigations and subsequent corrective or disciplinary actions.
For human rights and environmental issues involving suppliers, Ford has an external site to report supplier grievances.
The external site is available in five different languages and provides suppliers an opportunity to report feedback.
Employees of our suppliers can also provide feedback and file grievances directly via the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Worker Voice app.
FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 92 | | | | | | | FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Data Protection, Privacy and Cyber Security Data protection, privacy and security goes beyond compliance.
It is the foundation for customer trust at Ford – particularly in the new era of connected ecosystems.
We take that trust seriously as we work to deliver innovative products and a stellar experience.
Data privacy is a key component of our software-driven businesses.
Unsurprisingly, data privacy, which focuses on personal information and how it is collected, stored, used, managed and shared has become increasingly important to our customers, our employees and our business.
That’s why we view data privacy as a strategic issue, one that encompasses our relationship with our customers and how we manage privacy as a business asset.
DATA PRIVACY MODERNIZATION Ensuring our data privacy program is up to date is of paramount importance.
The Privacy Office led an initiative in 2022 to modernize our data privacy program and align it to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) privacy framework.
We are: • Developing a prioritized roadmap of risk remediation and management activities • Identifying key systems and places where personal information resides, processes that involve personal information, high-risk processes and vendors • Establishing governance posture including roles, responsibilities, policies, procedures and guidelines • Implementing technology and processes to operationalize the modernization program • Establishing processes to maintain risk identification, controls and treatment plans DATA PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES LEAD TO SAVINGS AND BETTER PRODUCTS Data privacy impacts the bottom line and improves the quality of Ford products.
Ford’s Privacy Office has helped the business realize significant operational savings in 2022.
The internal value business achieved cost avoidance for product quality, reductive design, and process efficiencies as of November 2022.
The Privacy Office, Global Data Insight & Analytics (GDI&A) and the Office of General Counsel (OGC) contributed by streamlining data access through policy simplification, which helped Internal Value use data to improve Ford products and reduce costs.
We also updated internal Ford policy to streamline data access for certain types of vehicle data.
This will enable GDI&A to apply more automation.
STRENGTHENING OUR GLOBAL DATA PRIVACY INITIATIVES We continue to adhere to the Automotive Consumer Privacy Protection Principles developed by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.
We maintain our engagement with the Automotive Cybersecurity Industry Consortium, a collaboration formed by the auto industry, research organizations, and government to strengthen cybersecurity in the automotive sector.
We are also a founding member of the Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which gathers, analyzes, and shares information to combat cyber-related threats and weaknesses.
We continue to maintain an industry-leading cybersecurity insurance program with many of the world’s largest and most respected insurance companies.
“ Enabling ethical and data-driven innovation deep ens Ford’s ‘always-on’ customer relationships while improving the lives of Ford owners, drivers, passengers, employees, and the general public.” REBECCA PAGANI, CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 93 | | | | | | | FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES Government Regulations, Policy and Engagement As a purpose-driven company, we match our advocacy policy with our values.
As a global company it’s imperative that Ford engage with governments and policy makers to ensure that our positions are represented and our actions are recognized.
Consistent engagement on our part will help ensure that we have a voice in shaping and complying with new regulations and policies that impact our employees, our customers and our shareholders.
Ford participates openly and transparently in the political process to support policies on the local, state, national, and international level that are economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable for our company, our customers, and their communities.
We work with the United States Congress and the White House, as well as international governments, on issues including trade, fuel economy, autonomous vehicles, mobility, and electric vehicles.
We advocate for consistent policies at all levels to help us achieve our business, environmental, and employment objectives.
We encourage all employees to participate in political and governmental affairs as individual citizens, while fully respecting their right to use personal time as they choose and to decide the extent and direction of their political activities.
It’s important that our management team keeps informed on governmental matters affecting Ford’s interests.
Where appropriate, they are expected to help formulate and present company positions on relevant public issues.
They also are expected to contribute to fulfilling Ford’s responsibilities as a corporate citizen, including participation in constructive governmental activities on behalf of the company.
Ford does not contribute to political candidates or political organizations; nor does the company employ its resources to help elect candidates to public office, even when permitted by law.
Ford does not take a position for partisan political purposes, that is, specifically for the purpose of advancing the interest of a political party or candidate for public office.
However, with the approval of the Office of the Chief Executive, contributions may be made to support or oppose a state or local ballot proposal if the issue is of significant interest or importance to Ford provided that such contributions are permitted by law.
Contributions not earmarked for individual candidates or political organizations are distributed at the discretion of Ford’s Political Contributions Committee.
Our advocacy efforts are guided by our Chief Policy Officer.
TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AND MEMBERSHIPS FOCUSING ON U.S. POLICY ISSUES To advance our voice on key issues, we collaborate with a broad range of coalitions, industry groups, and trade associations where we operate.
We work with our partners to develop and promote sensible policies that benefit our company, our industry, and society.
These organizations often bring diverse viewpoints to the debate, and sometimes their views are not shared by Ford.
When necessary, we have exercised our right to make our own position clear and at times have taken an alternative path.
Climate Change We are committed to developing and promoting climate policies that benefit our customers, company, industry, and society.
As a member of trade associations and coalitions, we work to make our position known and collaborate with others.
We leverage our memberships to move these organizations toward positions more aligned with Ford’s views on climate.
We will continue to make decisions based on what’s best for our customers, the environment, and our business.
Through active participation, we can encourage groups to align with our progressive climate change strategy, shape policy and drive the industry to change.

FORD BLUE TABLE FORUM Ford established the Blue Table Forum, a stakeholder advocacy program focused on creating and building a trusted community of organizational and institutional stakeholders from a diverse group of NGOs, nonprofits and academic institutions.
The program goal is to initiate a dialogue around critical issues faced and how we can work together to build a zeroemissions transportation future.
To-date, the program has engaged over 75 influential thought-leaders across 50 organizations with regional, national and global representation and a diverse stakeholder network of over 70 million including members, donors, volunteers, and partner organizations.
POLICY FRAMEWORK Under the Chief Policy Officer and General Counsel’s direction, a new policy framework was created to advance Ford’s business objectives while vindicating the company’s values.
The framework leverages the entire policy team, which is comprised of: • Environmental and Safety Compliance • Government Affairs • Office of General Counsel • Privacy • Security This structure empowers the teams to function as one, contributing the expertise of their respective professional disciplines, unified throughout the policy organization.
Ford’s ambitious Ford Policy Agenda, which sets forth detailed policy missions to defend and advance Ford Motor Company’s interests, reflects this integration.

Board Role and Responsibilities The Board continuously reviews our governance practices, assesses the regulatory and legislative environment, and adopts the governance practices that best serve the interests of our shareholders.
The Board is elected by and responsible to Ford’s shareholders.
Ford’s business is conducted by its employees, managers, and officers, under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and oversight of the Board, to enhance the long-term value of the Company for its shareholders.
The Board of Directors has chosen to separate the roles of CEO and Chair of the Board of Directors, which allows the CEO to focus on leading the organization to deliver product excellence, while the Chair leads the Board in its pursuit to provide the Company with direction on Company-wide issues such as sustainability, mobility, and stakeholder relationships.
The Board of Directors monitors the performance of the CEO and other members of senior management to ensure that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being served.
Diversity of skills, experience, race and ethnicity, and gender strengthens our competitive advantage and reflects the customers we serve, as well as our employees.
Together, our Board has a broad set of skills and experience that encompasses manufacturing, marketing, CEO leadership, international, government, risk management, finance and technology.
In addition, all of our Board members have backgrounds in sustainability and related matters.
Their experience with environmental/climate change, talent and culture, and social responsibility initiatives enables us to address key shareholder concerns regarding sustainability and corporate responsibility.
Of our 14 Board members, four are women, one is Black/ African American and one is Hispanic.
For additional information on the unique qualifications and demographic backgrounds of our Board members, refer to the Director Skills and Diversity Matrix and director biographies included in our most recent Proxy Statement.
Changes to the Board in 2022 The size of the Board was reduced from 15 directors to 14 directors when Anthony F. Earley, Jr. retired from the Board at the time of our May 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
John Thornton replaced Mr. Earley as the Lead Independent Director and Lynn Vojvodich Radakovich replaced Mr. Earley as the Chair of the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee.
u READ MORE ABOUT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON THE WEBSITE Corporate Governance Practices Sound corporate governance practices and trust go hand in hand.
Ford’s adoption of the following practices has played a critical role in creating the world’s most trusted company: • Annual Election of All Directors • Majority Vote Standard: Each director must be elected by a majority of votes cast • Independent Board: The majority of our directors are independent • Lead Independent Director: Ensures management is adequately addressing the matters identified by the Board • Independent Board Committees: Each of the Audit; Compensation, Talent and Culture; and Nominating and Governance Committees is made up entirely of independent directors • Committee Charters: Each standing committee operates under a written charter that has been approved by the Board and is reviewed annually External Stakeholder Engagements Sustainability Partnerships Executive Cabinet Ford Leadership Team & CEO Mobility Finance Ford Land Research & Innovation Global Data Insights & Analytics (GDI&A) Diversity, Equity & Inclusion People Matters Communications Purchasing Treasury Investor Relations Marketing General Counsel Environmental Quality Global Manufacturing Product Design & Development Automotive Safety Human Resources Team Edison Ford Credit Ford Fund BOARD OF DIRECTORS Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE VP, Chief Sustainability, Global Sustainability & ESG Meeting Strategic Priorities, Objectives & Performance Integrating Sustainability into all our Operations FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 96 | | | | | | | Accountable and Inclusive Governance – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES • Independent Directors Meet Regularly Without Management and NonIndependent Directors • Regular Board and Committee Self-Evaluation Process: The Board and each committee evaluates its performance each year • Mandatory Deferral of Compensation for Directors: In 2022, approximately 68% of the annual Board membership fee (not inclusive of additional fees earned for service as Lead Independent Director or Chair of a Committee) was mandatorily deferred into Ford restricted stock units, which strongly links the interests of the Board with those of shareholders • Separate Chair of the Board and CEO: The Board of Directors has chosen to separate the roles of CEO and Chair of the Board of Directors • Confidential Voting at Annual Meeting • Special Meetings: Shareholders have the right to call a special meeting • Shareholders May Take Action by Written Consent • Strong Codes of Ethics: Ford is committed to operating its business with the highest level of integrity.

u READ MORE IN THE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE IN THE MOST RECENT PROXY STATEMENT SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE We employ a variety of governance systems and processes to manage different aspects of sustainability across our business, as summarized throughout this report.
The Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee reviews and advises on the Company’s pursuit of innovative policies and technologies that promote product safety, improve environmental and social sustainability, and seek to enrich our customers’ experiences, increase shareholder value, and lead to a better world.
The committee is responsible for assessing the Company’s progress on strategic economic, product safety, environmental, and social issues, as well as the degree to which sustainability principles have been integrated into various skill teams.
The Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee reviews and advises on key people-related business strategies, including leadership succession planning, culture, DEI, and talent development programs.
MANAGEMENT PROCESSES The management processes, systems, committees, and groups outlined below serve as guardrails as we work to improve our sustainability performance, act ethically, and take responsibility for our impact on society, our planet, and communities across the globe.
BOARD’S ROLE IN RISK MANAGEMENT The oversight responsibility of the Board and its committees is supported by Company management and the risk management processes that are currently in place.
Ford has extensive and effective risk management processes, relating specifically to compliance, reporting, operating, and strategic risks.
These include: • Compliance Risk encompasses matters such as legal and regulatory compliance (for example, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, environmental, OSHA/safety, etc.).
• Reporting Risk covers Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, disclosure controls and procedures, and accounting compliance.
• Operating Risk addresses the myriad of matters related to the operation of a complex company such as Ford (for example, quality, supply chain, sales and service, financing and liquidity, product development and engineering, labor, etc.).
• Strategic Risk encompasses somewhat broader and longer-term matters, including, but not limited to, technology development, environmental and social sustainability, capital allocation, management development, retention and compensation, competitive developments, and geopolitical developments.
We believe that key success factors in risk management at Ford include a strong risk analysis tone set by the Board and senior management, which is shown through their commitment to effective top-down and bottom-up communication (including communication between management and the Board and committees), and active cross-functional participation among the Business Segments and Skill Teams.
We have institutionalized a regular Forecast, Controls and Risk Review and Special Attention Review process where the senior leadership of the Company reviews the status of the business, the risks, and opportunities presented to the business (in the areas of compliance, reporting, operating, and strategic risks), and develops specific plans to address those risks and opportunities.
The Enterprise Risk Management process adopted by the Company identifies the top critical enterprise risks through a survey process of senior management and the Board of Directors.
Once identified, each of the top risks is assigned an executive risk owner who is responsible to oversee risk assessment, develop mitigation plans, and provide regular updates.
The Enterprise Risk Management process also engages Business Segments and Skill Teams to determine which of the enterprise risks are most relevant to their specific objectives, and identify any additional risks that can be managed at a lower level in the organization.
All identified Enterprise Critical Risks are evaluated for their exposure to related geopolitical risk and climate change impacts.
The Audit Committee and Board annually review the process to update the list of critical risks and monitor risk movement and emerging trends, and the Enterprise Risk Management team also reviews the annual survey results with outside advisors to ensure the Company assessment is up to date with external risk developments.
As noted above, the full Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of risk management at Ford and oversees operating risk management with reviews at each of its regular Board meetings.
The Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for the oversight of specific areas FORD INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REPORT 2023 97 | | | | | | | Accountable and Inclusive Governance – continued FUNDAMENTALS STRATEGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE DATA APPENDICES of risk management to certain committees of the Board, with each Board committee reporting to the full Board following each committee meeting.
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing compliance and reporting risk and the Enterprise Risk Management process itself.
The Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing environmental and social sustainability risks, while the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing risks related to compensation and peoplerelated business strategies, including leadership succession and culture, diversity, and inclusion.
The Board and the appropriate committees also periodically review other policies related to personnel matters, including those related to sexual harassment and anti-retaliation policies related to whistleblowers.
The Board; the Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee; the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee; the Finance Committee; and the Audit Committee all play a role in overseeing operating and strategic risk management.
The scope and severity of risks presented by cyber threats have increased dramatically, and constant vigilance is required to protect against intrusions.
We take cyber threats very seriously and regularly audit our cyber security capabilities.
These audits are a useful tool for ensuring that we maintain a robust cyber security program to protect our investors, customers, employees, and intellectual property.
The Audit Committee receives updates several times per year from the Chief Information Security Officer regarding technology and cyber security risk and conducts regular reviews of our cyber security practices, with report outs to the Board as appropriate.
As part of its risk assessment procedures, the Board reviews relevant cyber security and information technology matters at least twice annually.
We also maintain an industry-leading cyber security insurance program with many of the world’s largest and most respected insurance companies.
Additionally, we are a founding member of the Board of the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
Our current seat on that board ensures that we preserve relationships that help to protect ourselves against both enterprise and in-vehicle security risks.

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) updates now require an organization to identify the most significant actual and potential impacts on the economy, environment and people.
Meanwhile, beginning in January 2024, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will require companies to adopt the concept of double materiality and report on two parameters: the topics that may impact the financial performance of the company and the company’s own impact on people and environment.
Our 2023 materiality methodology was updated to reflect these emerging guidelines and incorporate elements of double materiality.
Topic Identification We sought to achieve balance and completeness by developing a list of topics covering all ESG areas likely to be relevant across Ford’s value chain.
A preliminary list of ESG topics was compiled using business analysis, trend analysis, review of peers and leaders, and assessment of standards and frameworks.
Gathering Stakeholder Input To support topic prioritization we engaged internal and external stakeholders including industry associations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), internal subject matter experts, and Ford employees.
More than 600 Ford employees weighed in, responding to a first-of-its-kind outreach.
Assessing Input We scored stakeholder responses and weighted them to reflect the relative importance of each topic across two dimensions: Ford’s impact on the people and environment and the impact on Ford’s overall performance and business.
We combined the results of these two different lenses to build our materiality matrix and identify the topics we should focus on to have the greatest impact.
We considered the actual and potential, negative and positive impacts during this exercise, and also the employee prioritization of topics.

Lifetime CO2 emissions are calculated on a well-to-wheels basis, including CO2 from the internal combustion vehicle (ICEV) tailpipe, ICEV fuel production, and EV electricity production.
Lifetime miles for F-150 Lightning/Pickup (225,865) and Mustang Mach-E/Car SUV (195,264) are defined in 40 CFR 86.1865 12(k)(4) and for E-Transit/Transit useful life (150,000) in 49 CFR 535.5 (a)(10)(ii).
Tailpipe (tank-to-wheels) CO2 emissions are calculated by dividing 0.008887 metric tons CO2/gallon gasoline (EPA Automotive Trends Report) by the vehicle MPG and multiplying by the lifetime miles.
Fuel production CO2 emissions (well-to-tank) are calculated by multiplying the tailpipe CO2 by 0.25, following the 2021 U.S. EPA Automotive Trends Report methodology.
Electricity production CO2 emissions are calculated by multiplying the EV kWh/100 miles by the electric grid CO2-intensity 0.000440 metric tons CO2e/kWh and multiplying by the lifetime miles.
The comparable internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) MPG are the preliminary 2021 model year segment-average real-world values for Car SUV (30.5 MPG) and pickup (19.4 MPG), from the 2021 U.S. EPA Automotive Trends report (epa.gov/automotive-trends).
The 2022 model year F-150 Lightning Platinum (ext.
range) and Mustang Mach-E RWD (base range) city and highway kWh/100 mile were obtained from fueleconomy.gov/ and weighted 43% city, 57% highway to get real-world combined kWh/100 mile, following the 2021 U.S. EPA Automotive Trends Report methodology: F-150 Lightning Platinum (ext.
range) 51.7 kWh/100 miles and Mustang Mach-E RWD (base range) 33.3 kWh/100 miles.
Estimated city and highway MPG for ICEV Transit (130-inch wheelbase, low roof) analytically derived using models based on EPA test procedures and calculations for light-duty gasoline-powered vehicles set forth in 40 CFR Part 600, with inputs reflecting 2021 3.5L PFDI gasoline-powered Transit attributes including Average Loaded Vehicle Weight Engineering Test Weight (ALVW ETW).
Applying the EPA trends report real-world weightings of 43% city and 57% highway, gives combined real-world 17.3 MPG.
Estimates are illustrative only and not representative of all drivers or circumstances.
Actual mileage will vary based on external environment (including ambient temperature), driving behaviors, payload, vehicle use, vehicle, charging habits, lithiumion battery age and state of health, vehicle upfits and alterations, and other factors.
The estimated City and Highway kWh/100 miles for E-Transit (130-inch wheelbase, low roof) were analytically derived using models based on test procedures and calculations for light-duty electric vehicles set forth in 40 CFR Part 600, with inputs reflecting E-Transit attributes including Average Loaded Vehicle Weight Engineering Test Weight (ALVW ETW).
Applying the EPA trends report real-world weightings of 43% city and 57% highway, gives combined real-world 62.3 kWh/100 miles.
