Here are the latest developments: The attorney general, Pam Bondi, said that she is “deploying DOJ agents to ICE facilities—and wherever ICE comes under siege—to safeguard federal agents, protect federal property, and immediately arrest all individuals engaged in any federal crime.” Donald Trump posted a lengthy screed on social media in which he demanded that Microsoft fire its head of global affairs, Lisa Monaco. As deputy attorney general, Monaco had overseen criminal investigations of Trump’s effort to stay in office after losing the 2020 election and the Capitol riot on January 6 2021. Oregon lawmakers rejected Trump’s characterization of Portland as a scene of non-stop anarchy in dire need of federal troops as “a fable”. The FBI has fired about 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, AP reports. Asked by CNN to reflect on Trump’s second term so far, Kamala Harris replied: “It’s painful to see. I mean, what’s happening with Comey: Are you fucking kidding me? The United States Department of Justice?” The US supreme court on Friday extended an order that permits the Trump administration to not spend more than $4bn in congressionally appropriated foreign aid money that it is seeking to cancel. After the indictment of James Comey, the president told reporters that he hopes “more” political adversaries will be prosecuted. Both of Oregon’s senators and three of its representatives in Congress rejected Donald Trump’s latest false claims about mass anarchy in the city of Portland as a fiction intended to justify the unnecessary deployment of federal troops as part of an “authoritarian” crackdown. Speaking at a federal building in downtown Portland after oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facilities in the state, Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator, told reporters: “It’s important to recognize that the president’s argument is a fable, it does not resemble the truth.” “If he watches a TV show in the morning and he see Portland mentioned, he says it’s a terrible place,” Wyden added. During an Oval Office event to announce that the administration intends to investigate and disrupt what it claims is “organized political violence” funded by left-wing groups, Trump made several wild claims about Portland, which was a center of protests in 2020, after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, but life has long since returned to normal and barriers around the federal courthouse and police headquarters downtown have been removed. The president, however, apparently deceived by conservative outlets hyping video of a handful of protesters gathered outside an Ice facility in an outlying, residential neighborhood, insisted that the city has been in non-stop “anarchy” since 2020, and is barely livable. “Portland is, I don’t know how anybody lives there, it’s amazing. But it’s anarchy out there,” the president said. “You go out to Portland and you see what’s happening in Portland, this is like, nobody’s ever seen anything like it, every night, and this has gone on for years, they just burn the place down and you know the shop owners, most of them have left, but the few shops that are open, they just use plywood, just like 3/4 inch plywood, they don’t put store fronts in because they know it’s going to be burned down,” Trump insisted, falsely. Describing the small number of protesters who have gathered outside an Ice facility that has been illegally used for detentions in a residential southwest neighborhood, Trump claimed, without evidence: “These are professional agitators, these are bad people and they’re paid a lot of money by rich people.” “But we’re going to get out there and we’re gonna do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that,” the president said. “These aren’t your protesters that make the sign in their basement late in the evening because they really believe it,” the president added. “These are professional anarchists and agitators, and they get hired by wealthy people.” At Friday’s news conference, congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, an Oregon Democrat, said: “This proclaimed ‘war on Antifa’ is completely a fallacy. Antifa is an ideology, it is not a group, and so we’re extremely concerned with what he’s going to try to do with that pronouncement.” “Donald Trump does not care about safety. If he cared about safety he would not have released 1,600 convicted insurrectionists into the streets. He cares about control and authoritarianism,” she added. “Portland does not need the military. We do not want them, we do not need them, we do not welcome them to come here under his orders.” At the same news conference, Jeff Merkley, Oregon’s other Democratic senator, pointed out that when they visited the Ice facility this week, there were no protesters present at all. He also disputed the notion “that Trump is trying to make a rational point based on evidence.” “That is not correct. He is trying to project an image to justify forces that he can roll in to create chaos and then justify further authoritarian actions,” the senator added. He also drew attention to video evidence from the local newspaper, the Oregonian, which showed that a recent clash between federal agents and a small number of protesters outside the facility had been entirely due to violence by the agents against the protesters, who remained peaceful. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on Friday that she is “deploying DOJ agents to ICE facilities—and wherever ICE comes under siege—to safeguard federal agents, protect federal property, and immediately arrest all individuals engaged in any federal crime.” In her statement, posted on social media, Bondi added that she is responding to Donald Trump’s designation of certain forms of protest against immigration enforcement as acts of “terrorism” by instructing the FBI’s “Joint Terrorism Task Forces across the country to disrupt and investigate all entities and individuals engaged in acts of domestic terrorism, including the repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents.” “The Department of Justice,” Bondi said, “will seek the most serious available charges against all participants in these criminal mobs, including conspiracy offenses, assault offenses, civil disorder offenses, and terrorism offenses.” The FBI has fired about 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers prompted nationwide protests, three people familiar with the matter told the Associated Press. The bureau had first reassigned the agents last spring but has since fired them, said the people, who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel matters with The Associated Press. The number of FBI employees fired was not immediately clear, but two people said it was roughly 20. Jean-Frederic Dufour, the chief executive of Rolex, admitted in a letter to Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, that Donald Trump did bring up tariffs on Swiss imports, but only “in jest”, when he was a guest of the exclusive watchmaker during the US Open tennis final. Warren had written to the Rolex CEO to ask, given “the President’s record of doling out special treatment to CEOs who are able to woo him with flattery, payoffs, or both”, whether he had invited Trump to watch the match from the Rolex box shortly after high tariffs on goods from Switzerland were announced, “to curry favor with the President in an effort to secure special-interest exemptions for Rolex products”. “President Trump, never one to miss a rhetorical opportunity, did ask in jest whether he would have been invited had it not been for the tariffs – a moment that brought a round of laughter all around,” Dufour told Warren in a letter sent on Thursday. “Corruption is not a laughing matter,” Warren said in a statement on Friday. “While families are getting crushed by Trump’s chaotic tariffs, Donald Trump and his rich friends are laughing about tariffs in a fancy box sponsored by a luxury watch brand. How much more out of touch can Trump be?” The former vice-president, Kamala Harris, weighed in on the indictment of James Comey in blunt terms on Friday during an interview with CNN. Asked to reflect on Trump’s second term so far, Harris replied: “It’s painful to see. I mean, what’s happening with Comey: Are you fucking kidding me? The United States Department of Justice?” Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist and social media influencer who serves as an adviser to Donald Trump, has taken credit for the president demanding on Friday that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, the former deputy attorney general who coordinated investigations into Trump’s attempt to stay in power after losing the 2020 election. “After I alerted President Trump to the fact that [Microsoft] has hired Lisa Monaco to be their new President of Global Affairs, he has just called on Microsoft to terminate her employment,” Loomer wrote on X. She then tagged the Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella and asked him: “are you going to comply?” When Loomer first drew attention to Monaco’s hiring by Microsoft in July, she also noted that Reid Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor she described as a “Jeffrey Epstein associate” is “on the board of Microsoft.” When Trump was asked on Thursday in the Oval Office to name some of the “wealthy people” he was accusing of hiring “professional agitators” to carry out political violence, he said: “I hear names of some pretty rich people that are radical-left people… I hear about a guy named Reid Hoffman.” Days before hundreds of top US military commanders have been ordered to gather at a marine corps base in Virginia next week, Pentagon officials are preparing for possible strikes on suspected drug traffickers inside Venezuela in the coming weeks, NBC News reports, citing unnamed sources. Critics of Donald Trump have already accused him of seeking to use military strikes against suspected drug traffickers off the coast of Venezuela in recent weeks as a distraction from the clamor over his administration’s decision not to release files from the investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender Trump socialized with for more than a decade. If US strikes escalate to targets inside Venezuela, Democrats could echo the claims made by Republicans in 1998 when Bill Clinton fired dozens of Tomahawk missiles at a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan and a training camp in Afghanistan associated with Osama bin Laden. Those 20 August 1998 strikes were launched two weeks after al-Qaida had killed 224 people in bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, but also just three days after Clinton had admitted to an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. A chorus of Republicans quickly accused Clinton of trying to create a foreign crisis to distract attention away from the sex scandal, and the accusation was reflected on the banners and signs of Sudanese protesters who marched in Khartoum that weekend holding up a large, handmade sign with an image of Lewinsky emblazoned with the slogan: “No War for Monika.” At a Pentagon news conference after the strikes aimed at the then relatively unknown bin Laden, one reporter asked Clinton’s defense secretary, William Cohen, about suggestions that the timing of the attack bore “a striking resemblance to Wag the Dog”, the 1997 film about a White House that hires a Hollywood producer to create a fake war to divert the public from a sex scandal involving the president. “The only motivation driving this action today was our absolute obligation to protect the American people from terrorist activities,” Cohen replied. “That is the sole motivation.” “I don’t think any president, regardless of party, would ever take military action to distract from personal problems,” Dee Dee Myers, Clinton’s former press secretary, told Jay Leno that week in an appearance on the Tonight Show. “Most of the Congress, most of the American people I think, will say: ‘I don’t believe that our president, regardless of how bad things are, would do that.’” Donald Trump appeared to admit on Friday evening that his optimism about a deal to end the war in Gaza, expressed on Friday morning, had been premature. “I am pleased to report that we are having very inspired and productive discussions with the Middle Eastern Community concerning Gaza,” the president wrote on his personal social media platform, hours after Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told the United Nations that Israel’s military was “no done yet.” “Intense negotiations have been going on for four days, and will continue for as long as necessary,” Trump added. Hours earlier, as he left the White House to cheer on the American Ryder Cup golf team, Trump told reporters: “It’s looking like we have a deal on Gaza.” “I think it’s a deal that will get the hostages back, it’s going to be a deal that will end the war,” he added. “It’s going to be peace. I think we have a deal.” By nightfall in Washington however, Trump had retreated to merely claiming that there was “Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done”. Local TV conglomerate Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar Media Group said their ABC-affiliate stations will start airing Jimmy Kimmy Live! again on Friday night, ending their preempting of the show. Sinclair and fellow station owner Nexstar had continued to preempt Kimmel’s late-night talkshow even after ABC had put Kimmel back on air. Together, Sinclair and Nexstar’s preemption of the show left about 25% of TV viewers in the US unable to watch it, with the two companies owning 70 ABC-affiliate stations combined. After a frustrating morning of watching American golfers lose three of the first four Ryder Cup matches to their European rivals, Donald Trump got back to work on Friday, by posting a lengthy screed on social media in which he demanded that Microsoft fire its head of global affairs, Lisa Monaco. Monaco is the former deputy attorney general who oversaw the justice department’s investigation into Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot. In March, Trump signed an executive order rescinding Monaco’s security clearance, along with those of Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney and others. In his social media post, Trump wrote that it was shocking that Monaco, who was Barack Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser before later becoming Merrick Garland’s second in command at the justice department during the Biden administration, had been hired for “a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information”. “Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand,” the president added. “She is a menace to US National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government.” “It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco,” Trump concluded. The US supreme court on Friday extended an order that permits the Trump administration to not spend more than $4bn in congressionally appropriated foreign aid money that it is seeking to cancel. The unsigned order from the court’s conservative majority, over the objections of the court’s three liberals, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, lifted a lower court’s order that the administration was obliged to spend funds appropriated by Congress. Late last month, Trump informed the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, that he would not spend $4.9bn in foreign aid that Congress had previously approved, decrying it as “woke, weaponized and wasteful spending”. The money was to go to United Nations organizations and peacekeeping operations, as well as development assistance and democracy-promotion projects. The court’s majority wrote that Trump’s authority over foreign affairs weighed heavily in its decision, while cautioning that it was not making a final ruling in the case. “The effect is to prevent the funds from reaching their intended recipients — not just now but (because of their impending expiration) for all time,” Kagan wrote in her dissent, joined by Sotomayor and Jackson. “Because that result conflicts with the separation of powers, I respectfully dissent.” I’ve just spoken with Glenn Ivey, the Maryland Democratic congressman, who took part in the House Democrats’ virtual caucus meeting today. He noted that lawmakers were “resolute” on the call, but ultimately since both sides are “dug in” he expects a government shutdown next week. However, Ivey said that he finds it “hard to see” how Democrats get blamed for it. “What are the Democrats doing that they’re going to see as obstructing?” he said. “It’s holding out for healthcare … We’re trying to keep grandma in the nursing home, keep your monthly payments from tripling in January. I mean, they’re really going to be mad at us for that?” Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have said, repeatedly, that since Democrats aren’t budging on accepting the GOP’s “clean” continuing resolution, they would be responsible for government shutdown at the end of September. Currently, the Republican-written bill is languishing in the Senate, and the House speaker, Mike Johnson, has vowed to not call the lower chamber back until after funding lapses in just a few days. After the office of management and budget sent out a memo this week to federal agencies, telling them to brace for more layoffs in the event of a government shutdown, Ivey (whose district borders Washington DC and includes many federal workers) said that many of his constituents have already felt the impact of reductions in force since Trump returned to the White House. “[The administration] has done everything they can to get rid of as many federal employees as possible,” Ivey said. “So they’re not, they’re not really seeing how things would be different.” Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat who just won a special election to replace her late father, Raúl Grijalva, in Congress, suggested on Thursday that her swearing-in might be delayed by Republican House leaders because she has promised to sign a discharge petition calling for the release of files on the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender who socialized with Donald Trump for over a decade. Grijalva told the MeidasTouch Network, a liberal podcast, that she intends to be in Washington on Monday but has been told that she will have to wait for official results to be certified before being sworn in. She noted that this is a departure from procedure, as just a few weeks ago another Democrat, James Walkinshaw, was sworn in the day after his election. Two Republicans who won special elections earlier this year were also sworn in the day after their victories. “Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I’m number 218,” Grijalva said, meaning that her signature on the discharge petition would mean that a majority of the House backed the measure to compel the justice department to release all of the Epstein files, against the wishes of the president. Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee sent a letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, today, accusing the justice department of being weaponized by Donald Trump. They cite recent examples, including Thursday’s indictment of James Comey, and the president’s move to force out Erik Siebert from his role as the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia and replace him with a White House staffer and Trump ally. “Our justice system operates on the principle that the president cannot demand the prosecution of an individual to settle personal scores, let alone when there is no credible evidence that a person engaged in any wrongdoing,” the lawmakers wrote. The senators, led by the committee’s ranking member, Dick Durbin, are demanding that the Department of Justice provide documentation into several ongoing investigations, and interviews with several officials, including Ed Martin – a Trump loyalist who is now in charge of the DoJ group investigating the “weaponization” of the justice system. Democrats on the House oversight committee have released a tranche of partial records from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, which include flight logs, diary appointments and a financial ledger. In the partially redacted documents, there are several emailed schedules over the years, which include: A 2019 breakfast with former White House adviser Steve Bannon. Lunch in 2017 with billionaire and Trump ally Peter Thiel. A potential visit from Elon Musk to Epstein’s island in 2014. There is also a flight log from 2000, which lists Prince Andrew as a passenger on Epstein’s private plane. “It should be clear to every American that Jeffrey Epstein was friends with some of the most powerful and wealthiest men in the world,” said oversight spokesperson Sara Guerrero. “Every new document produced provides new information as we work to bring justice for the survivors and victims. Oversight Democrats will not stop until we identify everyone complicit in Epstein’s heinous crimes.” However, the committee’s Republican leadership said the records were “old news”, and that the members in the minority were “conveniently withholding documents that contain the names of Democratic officials”. “Once again they are putting politics over victims,” Republicans said. “We are releasing them all soon.” Nineteen people detained at an immigration detention center that the Trump administration opened within Louisiana’s infamous Angola prison were entering their fifth day on hunger strike on Sunday, according to advocacy groups. Those striking at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) processing center set up at Angola’s former Camp J are demanding access to medical and mental health care – including prescription medications, according to the Southeast Dignity Not Detention Coalition (SEDND) and the National Immigration Project (NIPNLG). A statement from both groups says that detainees at the facility the Trump administration has dubbed “the Louisiana Lockup” are also asking for basic necessities such as toilet paper, hygiene products and clean drinking water. Further, they seek visitation from Ice officers to raise concerns about conditions inside the facility. People with chronic health conditions are not receiving prescribed medications, according to the SEDND and NIPNLG statement, and there is no access to services such as a law library or religious programming, which are required under federal detention standards. Angola’s official name is the Louisiana state penitentiary. The strike there comes after Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, declared a state emergency in July to address what he said is a lack of capacity to house offenders at the prison. Sinclair – the company which owns more than 35 ABC affiliates– said today that it will “end its preemption of Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and the show will return tonight across its stations. This comes after several lawmakers criticized Sinclair for deciding to keep the late-night show off the air, despite Disney’s decision to end the suspension earlier this week, following Kimmel’s criticism of the Trump administration in the wake of the Charlie Kirk shooting. In a statement the broadcast conglomerate said: Over the last week, we have received thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers, and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives. We have also witnessed troubling acts of violence, including the despicable incident of a shooting at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento. These events underscore why responsible broadcasting matters and why respectful dialogue between differing voices remains so important. According to Reuters, Sinclair’s ABC stations represent about 14% of US households. Another ABC station owner, Nextstar Media Group, has kept Jimmy Kimmel’s show off the air – after Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr put pressure on ABC affiliates to suspend the show or risk losing their broadcast licenses. In a quick press conference today on Capitol Hill, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, scolded the president for his trip to New York today. “Donald Trump, get back to Washington DC. Why are you at a golf event right now and the government is four days away from closing?” the congressman said. “That’s outrageous. And it speaks to the fact that these extremists could care less about the health, safety and economic wellbeing of the American people. They’re on vacation right now.” Fewer than 24 hours after the indictment of James Comey, the president said that he hopes “more” political adversaries will be prosecuted. Speaking to reporters before he left DC to attend the Ryder Cup in New York, Trump maintained that the former FBI director’s prosecution was “about justice … not about revenge”. The president kicked off the day with Truth Social posts that called Comey “a dirty cop” and “destroyer of lives”. Meanwhile, Democrats and legal experts say the indictment is latest sign Trump is turning the justice system into weapon to silence critics, as my colleague Chris Stein reports. Trump also continued to blame Democrats for a looming government shutdown. A reminder that lawmakers have yet to pass a resolution to keep the government funded beyond 30 September. Today, the president held up his side of the blame game, telling reporters: “These people are crazy, the Democrats. So if it has to shut down, it’ll have to shut down, but they’re the ones that are shutting down.” For their part, House Democrats will meet virtually today for a caucus meeting, as they refuse to back any funding bill without several healthcare provisions. Democrats on the House judiciary committee are asking its Republican leader to allow victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his associates to testify about “the institutional failures that enabled these horrific crimes”. The letter, signed by 17 Democrats and led by ranking member Jamie Raskin and congresswoman Deborah Ross, a leader in the Democratic Women’s caucus and longtime champion of sexual violence survivors, comes amid continued pressure for the Trump administration to authorize the release of more files related to the disgraced financier. Congressman Raskin said that the indictment of James Comey is because the justice department is in “full cover-up mode” over the Epstein files. In an interview with CNN, the Democrat from Maryland called the prosecution an example of the “complete politicization of the Department of Justice”. He added: “We’re in the midst of trying to get this information with apparently real crimes. And we’ve got a strong, bipartisan majority saying, ‘Stop the cover-up of the Epstein files. Just go ahead and release them.’” An federal immigration officer has been “relieved of his duties” after a video showing him pushing a woman to the floor at an immigration court in New York City spread quickly on social media. Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said that the agent’s actions were “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of Ice”. McLaughlin added that the officer is “being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation”. An Arizona Republican state representative who has expressed support for January 6 insurrectionists on Wednesday called for a Democratic congresswoman to be executed, as a response to a video clip. The comment on X by state representative John Gillette of Kingman, Arizona, first reported by the Arizona Mirror, was a reaction to a short clip drawn from a YouTube video in March by US representative Pramila Jayapal, a longtime Democratic congresswoman representing Washington state, titled The Resistance Lab. In the video, Jayapal discusses preparations for street protests against the Trump administration. “Until people like this, that advocate for the overthrow of the American government are tried, convicted and hanged … it will continue,” he posted. Nothing in either the clip or the longer video actually suggests Jayapal is advocating for the overthrow of the US government. The video carries explicit calls for non-violent protest and discussed with alarm a rise in political violence in the US. Gillette’s comment is a continuation of a string of inflammatory far-right online invective by the Mohave county Republican and retired army reserve command sergeant major. Gillette has defended January 6 protesters, who were intent on violently overturning Trump’s defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, as “political prisoners” and described Muslims as “terrorists”. It also reflects a widening call among Republicans to criminalize protest and speech critical of the Trump administration. Gillette has not yet responded to a request from the Guardian for comment. An federal immigration officer has been “relieved of his duties” after a video showing him pushing a woman to the floor at an immigration court in New York City spread quickly on social media. Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said that the agent’s actions were “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of Ice”. “This officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,” McLaughlin added. The video shows a woman, and a young girl who appears to be her daughter, pleading to officers to not take away her husband at 26 Federal Plaza. In the video, they are crying as officers take him into custody. ProPublica identified the woman as Monica Moreta-Galarza, from Ecuador. The video captures Moreta-Galarza pleading with the now-suspended officer. He tries to dismiss her by saying “adios”. When Moreta-Galarza touches his shoulder, he grabs her, pushes her across the hallway, against the wall, and on to the floor. After the incident, Democratic congressman Dan Goldman, of New York, said that Moreta-Galarza “fled” to his office with her two young children. ProPublica also reported that Moreta-Galarza was later taken to hospital after being pushed to the ground. Ahead of House Democrats’ meeting today, as a government shutdown looms, Donald Trump continued to blame lawmakers across the aisle for any lapse in government funding earlier today. “These people are crazy, the Democrats. So if it has to shut down, it’ll have to shut down, but they’re the ones that are shutting down,” the president said. A reminder that Congress is in recess this week, and only the Senate is set to return on Monday – before funding expires at midnight on 30 September. A continuing resolution to keep the government open stalled in the upper chamber last week. Per my colleague Chris Stein’s reporting earlier, that Democrats on the House judiciary committee are calling Republican leadership to allow survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse to testify, congressman Jamie Raskin – the committee’s ranking member – said that the indictment of James Comey is because the justice department is in “full cover-up mode”. “They’re doing the bidding of President Trump with respect to Mr Comey, they’re doing the bidding of President Trump with respect to covering up cases,” Raskin said in an interview with CNN News Central. He added: What we see is the complete politicization of the Department of Justice. But we’re in the midst of trying to get this information with apparently real crimes. And we’ve got a strong, bipartisan majority saying, ‘Stop the cover-up of the Epstein files. Just go ahead and release them.’” For Donald Trump, the indictment of former FBI director and longtime foe James Comey was “justice in America”. Legal observers and lawmakers see something far more troubling. A former Republican appointed to lead the bureau by Barack Obama and kept on by Trump until he was fired in 2017, Comey was indicted Thursday on charges related to allegedly lying to Congress five years ago during a hearing on the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. The charges were filed in the eastern district of Virginia only after Erik Siebert was forced out as US attorney for reportedly finding no grounds to indict Comey. The justice department replaced him with Trump loyalist with little prosecutorial experience, Lindsey Halligan, and shortly after, a grand jury indicted Comey on one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The indictment is the latest sign that the president is making good on his promise “to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics”, said Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. “This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power. Our system depends on prosecutors making decisions based on evidence and the law, not on the personal grudges of a politician determined to settle scores,” Warner said. Democratic senator Adam Schiff, a former federal prosecutor who played a lead role in Trump’s first impeachment, said on X he had “never witnessed such a blatant abuse of the” justice department, calling it “little more than an arm of the president’s retribution campaign”. Mike Zamore, national director of policy and government affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union, said Trump “has yet again proven his disdain for the principles that have actually made America great”. Read the rest of Chris’s piece here: Bryan Graham at Bethpage Black Donald Trump’s arrival dominated the opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, about 37 miles south-east of Manhattan, where fans had begun lining up outside the gates as early as 3am. Helicopters circled constantly overhead, while spectators navigated TSA-style checkpoints and Secret Service patrols around the main grandstand. Shortly after 11am, Air Force One made a low, close flyover of the grounds as it approached Farmingdale, drawing gasps from the crowd and reminding everyone of the president’s imminent appearance. Officials had urged spectators to budget extra time, wary of the sort of disruption seen at the US Open tennis tournament earlier this month, when Trump’s visit delayed entry and thousands of spectators missed the start of the men’s final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. At Bethpage, Trump’s presence was no less inescapable. The early carnival atmosphere – fans chanting “U-S-A” as the American pair of Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas won the opening hole – quickly dulled as Europe seized control. By midday, the sport itself had receded. What lingered was the sound of choppers, the roar of Air Force One overhead, and the heavy security presence behind the 18th green and near the first tee that turned golf’s biennial matchplay carnival into a backdrop for presidential theatre. Responding to James Comey’s indictment last night, Matthew Miller, who was the director of public affairs at the justice department during the Obama administration, wrote on X: The Justice Department we have long known is dead. As in many authoritarian states, it now exists as an arm of the government to punish the president’s enemies, regardless of the law. A tragedy for the country with lasting implications, even if this case is dismissed. The chair of the House select committee on China has said he will conduct full oversight over a deal for Chinese-based ByteDance to sell the US assets of TikTok that was approved by Donald Trump under a 2024 law. “The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,” said the Republican representative John Moolenaar. He said he would host the leadership of the new TikTok entity at a hearing next year. Immigrants with no criminal record are now the largest group in US immigration detention, according to data released by the government. The number of people with no criminal history arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and detained by the Trump administration has now surpassed the number of those charged with crimes. Ice, the federal agency most heavily relied upon by Donald Trump to carry out his mass deportation campaign, released its latest numbers on Thursday. According to the official data, 16,523 people in immigration detention with no criminal record were arrested by Ice, compared with 15,725 who do have a criminal record and 13,767 with pending criminal charges. There are now a total of 59,762 people in Ice detention across the US. The remaining number of people in Ice custody were brought in by border officials. The numbers released by Ice mark the first time under the second Trump administration that the total number of immigrants with no criminal history in detention has surpassed that of people convicted of a crime or with pending charges. The agency’s data also contradicts Trump administration officials’ repeated narrative that the chief focus of the White House’s agenda and the Department of Homeland Security dragnet is dangerous criminals. Read my full report with Will Craft below. James Comey’s son-in-law, Troy Edwards, has resigned as a federal prosecutor for the eastern district of Virginia, following his father-in-law’s indictment. According to his resignation letter, seen by multiple outlets, Edwards sent his resignation notice to Lindsey Halligan – the newly minted US attorney for the district – and wrote that he was quitting “to uphold my oath to the constitution and the country”. A reminder that Halligan was appointed after Trump fired her predecessor, Erik Siebert, after Siebert said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Comey and other Trump adversaries. Edwards was on the team of attorneys who charged participants in the January 6 attack on the US capitol. Democrats on the House judiciary committee are asking its Republican leader to allow victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his associates to testify about “the institutional failures that enabled these horrific crimes”. The letter, signed by 17 Democrats and led by ranking member Jamie Raskin and congresswoman Deborah Ross, a leader in the Democratic Women’s caucus and longtime champion of sexual violence survivors, comes amid continued pressure for the Trump administration to authorize the release of more files related to the disgraced financier. “The release of Justice Department files related to the sex trafficking ring led by Mr Epstein, while necessary, is not a substitute for the voices of these survivors,” the letter reads. “The House Judiciary Committee has an important role to play in addressing the institutional failures that enabled these horrific crimes and failed to protect the women and girls he trafficked and abused.” Testimony by the survivors – some of whom appeared at a press conference outside the US Capitol earlier this month – “will help Congress to better understand the systemic breakdowns and shortcomings that enabled Mr Epstein’s network to operate for so long, including potential gaps in law enforcement practices, prosecutorial discretion, victim protection protocols, reporting requirements, and institutional oversight.” A spokesperson for the committee’s Republican chair, Jim Jordan, did not respond to a request for comment. The demand comes as a petition to force a vote in the House on legislation to release the Epstein files draws near to receiving the 218th signature necessary for its success, after Democrat Adelita Grijalva won a special election for a vacant seat earlier this week. Earlier, on the south lawn of the White House, Donald Trump took a few questions from reporters. “It’s about justice, it’s not about revenge,” the president said with regard to James Comey’s indictment. “He didn’t think he’d be caught, and he got caught,” Trump said, referring to the former FBI director he fired in 2017. “He lied. He lied a lot.” The president also said that he hopes “there will be others” who are prosecuted. Without giving much detail, the president also said that he “thinks we have a deal with Gaza”. “I think it’s a deal that will get the hostages back. It’s going to be a deal that will end the war,” he said. “That’ll be number eight,” he added, referring to his misleading list of conflicts that he’s resolved since he returned to the White House. The president has just left DC to attend the Ryder Cup tournament in New York. He didn’t stop for questions as he boarded the plane. Barbara McQuade, former US attorney for the eastern district of Michigan, made a key point on social media today about the grounds for a Comey conviction. She notes that while “probable cause is legally sufficient” in order to obtain an indictment, the justice department policy requires enough evidence to “obtain and sustain a conviction”. “That means proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” she adds. Right now, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is speaking at the United Nations general assembly in New York. According to my colleague Amy Sedghi, before he started speaking, dozens of delegates in the hall walked out. There were boos and cheers. Netanyahu just thanked Donald Trump for his “his bold, decisive action against Iran” earlier this year. As a reminder, that you can follow the latest developments at our dedicated liveblog below. Donald Trump’s long public campaign to get someone in his administration to bring criminal charges against James Comey, the former FBI director he fired in 2017, finally succeeded on Thursday. But the president has been so public about his loathing of the indicted man, and his desire to see him jailed, that it might be hard for prosecutors to convince a jury that the case was not brought for political reasons. Comey was fired by Trump in 2017 after he reportedly refused a request to pledge his loyalty to the newly elected president, and then publicly confirmed to Congress that the FBI was conducting a counterintelligence investigation of Russian efforts to help Trump get elected in 2016. Trump’s firing of Comey backfired, however, because it helped convince then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel, former FBI director Robert Mueller, to, in his words, “oversee the previously confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters”. Although Mueller’s report, issued in 2019, concluded that his team “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities”, the investigation unearthed evidence that a Russian effort did take place and, in Mueller’s words, “established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome”. Mueller added that the Trump campaign “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts”. The indictment of Comey comes as Trump seeks to use the power of the justice department to punish a man he sees as a central figure in the Russia investigation he has continually described as “a witch-hunt” and “a hoax”. The House Democratic caucus will meet virtually today at 2pm EST, ahead of a looming government shutdown just five days away. Congressional Democrats have so far been united in their push-back on the Republican-written resolution to extend government funding until 21 November. For the president’s part, he cancelled a meeting with Democratic leadership that was scheduled for this week. Democrats have also called the memo by the office of management and budget (OMB) – which told federal agencies to prepare for a reduction in force in the event of a shutdown – an intimidation tactic. The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, called Russ Vought, the director of the OMB, a “malignant political hack” earlier this week, and told him to “get lost”. “We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,” Jeffries added. In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that the indictment of former FBI director James Comey “represents a grotesque abuse of presidential power”. “By firing his previously appointed U.S. Attorney and installing someone who would do his bidding and bring criminal charges at his direction. President Trump has yet again proven his disdain for the principles that have actually made America great,” said Mike Zamore, the ACLU’s national director of policy and government affairs. “The president and his administration have corrupted our system of justice to turn his campaign of retribution into reality.” Donald Trump will leave the White House at about 9:50am EST to attend the Ryder Cup golf tournament in Bethpage, New York. We’ll keep an eye out for the president if he speaks to reporters en route. He’ll spend the day at the competition before heading back to DC at 3:30pm EST. President Donald Trump insisted South Korea will provide billions of dollars in investments “upfront”, despite Seoul’s assertion that it would suffer a financial crisis if it meets the US demands without safeguards. In July, South Korea pledged $350bn toward US projects, but has balked at US demands for control over the funds and South Korean officials say talks to formalise their trade deal are at a deadlock. Earlier this month, Trump formalised a trade deal with Japan, lowering tariffs on Japanese automobile imports and other products in return for $550bn of Japanese investment in US projects, and US officials have pressed Seoul to follow suit. “We have in Japan it’s $550bn, South Korea’s $350bn. That’s upfront,” Trump told reporters on Thursday in the Oval Office as he touted the amount of money he said his sweeping tariffs have brought in. South Korea, however, says it cannot afford to structure its investments in the same way as Japan, and president Lee Jae Myung told Reuters last week that without safeguards such as a currency swap, South Korea’s economy could be plunged into crisis. Well, the president is awake. Donald Trump has posted the following on his Truth Social social media network: JAMES COMEY IS A DIRTY COP. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! That outburst came shortly a more detailed post in which he called former FBI director James Comey “corrupt\". Trump wrote: Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can’t imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED! It is not a complex lie, it’s a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been, but he was just assigned a Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge, so he’s off to a very good start. Nevertheless, words are words, and he wasn’t hedging or in dispute. He was very positive, there was no doubt in his mind about what he said, or meant by saying it. He left himself ZERO margin of error on a big and important answer to a question. He just got unexpectedly caught. James “Dirty Cop” Comey was a destroyer of lives. He knew exactly what he was saying, and that it was a very serious and far reaching lie for which a very big price must be paid! President DJT Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said he and President Donald Trump had made “meaningful progress” on a range of regional and bilateral issues at their first meeting in the White House in six years, where they discussed defence cooperation and trade. Trump told reporters after Thursday’s meeting with Erdogan that he believed Nato member Turkey would agree to his request to stop purchasing Russian oil and said that he may lift US sanctions on Ankara so it can buy advanced American F-35 jets, Reuters reported. In comments to reporters on his flight home from Washington, Erdogan said the two leaders had exchanged views on steps to boost trade, including the revision of customs duties to achieve their target of $100bn trade volume. “It’s certainly impossible to resolve every issue in a single meeting. However, this meeting has led to meaningful progress on many issues,” Erdogan said, according to a transcript of his comments shared by his office on Friday. Erdogan added that he had left the meeting with Trump “happy”. A group of Disney investors is asking the company to turn over documents related to the company’s decision to temporarily suspend Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show, amid charges the media company may have been “complicit in succumbing” to media censorship. The investors, composed of lawyers for the American Federation of Teachers and Reporters Without Borders, noted that Disney’s stock “suffered significant declines in response to the company’s abrupt decision to suspend Mr. Kimmel and his show”, it said in a letter to Disney. “The fallout from suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! sparked criticism as an attack on free speech, triggered boycotts and union support for Mr. Kimmel, and caused Disney’s stock to plummet amid fears of brand damage and concerns that Disney was complicit in succumbing to the government overreach and media censorship,” the letter said. The lawyers are demanding “copies of any meeting minutes, meeting agenda and written materials provided to the [company’s] board or presented at any meeting of the board” regarding Kimmel’s decision. It cites a law in Delaware, where Disney is incorporated, that says shareholders can receive materials around board discussion “to investigate potential wrongdoing, mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty by members [of the board]”. Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday outlining the terms of a deal to transfer TikTok to a US owner. Trump said he and China’s president Xi Jinping had come to an agreement to allow TikTok to continue operating in the US, separating the social media platform from its Chinese owner ByteDance. Trump said the deal complies with a law that would have forced the shutdown of the app for American users had it not been divested and sold to a US owner. “I spoke with President Xi and he said, ‘Go ahead with it,’” Trump said at a press conference. “This is going to be American-operated all the way.” Under the plan, US investors will take over the majority of TikTok’s operations and take charge of a licensed copy of the app’s powerful recommendation algorithm. American companies are expected to own about 65% of the US version of the spun-off company, while ByteDance and Chinese investors will own less than 20%. The new version of TikTok will be controlled by a seven-member board of directors made up of cybersecurity and national security experts, six of them Americans, according to the White House. The new US company will be valued at $14bn, according to JD Vance, who also spoke at the press conference, a number far lower than the valuation for ByteDance overall, which is estimated to be around $330bn. By comparison, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, is valued at $1.8tn. The group of American TikTok investors is led by the US software giant Oracle, which will oversee TikTok’s US operations, provide cloud service for user data storage and get a license to take control of the app’s algorithm. White House officials have said ByteDance and Chinese officials will not have access to US user data. The Open Society Foundations (OSF), the major philanthropic group funded by George Soros, has criticized the Trump administration for “politically motivated attacks on civil society” after a report that the justice department had instructed federal prosecutors to come up with plans to investigate the charity. The New York Times reported on Thursday that a lawyer in the office of Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, sent a memo to several federal prosecutors in attorney’s offices in California, New York, Washington DC, Chicago and Detroit, offering a range of charges to consider against the group. Those charges included racketeering, arson, wire fraud and material support for terrorism, the newspaper reported. The push comes as Trump has ramped up efforts to deploy the justice department to target his enemies. He has pledged to crack down on leftwing groups in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing and has repeatedly singled out Soros, a major funder of liberal groups, as a target. “We’re going to look into Soros, because I think it’s a Rico case against him and other people,” Trump said on 12 September, using an acronym to refer to racketeering charges. “Because this is more than like protests. This is real agitation.” In a statement, the OSF described the effort as “meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with and undermine the first amendment right to free speech”. “The Open Society Foundations unequivocally condemn terrorism and do not fund terrorism. Our activities are peaceful and lawful, and our grantees are expected to abide by human rights principles and comply with the law,” it said in a statement. Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook urged the US supreme court on Thursday to reject Donald Trump’s attempt to fire her, telling the justices the Republican president’s unprecedented move would destroy the central bank’s independence and disrupt financial markets. Lawyers for Cook filed a written response opposing the justice department’s 18 September emergency request to lift a federal judge’s order that blocked Trump from immediately removing Cook, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden, while her legal challenge continues. Granting Trump’s request, her lawyers told the supreme court, “would dramatically alter the status quo, ignore centuries of history and transform the Federal Reserve into a body subservient to the president’s will”. Washington-based US district judge Jia Cobb ruled on 9 September that Trump’s claims that Cook committed mortgage fraud before taking office – allegations that Cook denies – likely were not sufficient grounds for removal under the 1913 law that created the Fed. The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit in a 2-1 ruling on 15 September denied the administration’s request to put Cobb’s order on hold, ruling that Cook likely was denied due process in violation of the US constitution’s fifth amendment. In Thursday’s filing, Cook’s lawyers said the Fed’s “unique history of independence” has helped make the US economy the strongest in the world. Siding with Trump, they wrote, “would signal to the financial markets that the Federal Reserve no longer enjoys its traditional independence, risking chaos and disruption”. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, sued Trump in August after the president announced he would remove her. Cook has said the claims made by Trump against her did not give him the legal authority to remove her and were a pretext to fire her for her monetary policy stance. The White House is telling federal agencies to prepare large-scale firings of workers if the government shuts down next week in a partisan fight over spending plans – prompting the Democrats to accuse Donald Trump of intimidation tactics. In a memo released on Wednesday night, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said agencies should consider a reduction in force for federal programs whose funding would lapse next week, is not otherwise funded and is “not consistent with the president’s priorities”. That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once the US Congress approved a new financial plan. A mass firing would eliminate employees positions, which would trigger yet another massive upheaval in a federal workforce that has already faced major rounds of cuts this year, leading with the dramatic intervention by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) early in the second Trump administration. When asked by reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon about the possibility of a government shutdown, Trump said: “Could be, yeah, because the Democrats are crazed. They don’t know what they’re doing.” Asked whether he would agree to a request from Democrats for an extension of subsidies for the costs of healthcare plans under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, on which millions of Americans depend for health insurance – which has become the sticking point in negotiations over the government funding bill – Trump simply repeated his false claim that Democrats are insisting on funding “to give the money to illegal aliens”. Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum on Thursday aimed at reining in what he has called a radical leftwing domestic “terror network” but which seemed likely to meet fierce legal pushback from critics depicting it as a licence for a broad crackdown on his political opponents. Prompted by journalists, Trump suggested that George Soros, the billionaire Hungarian-born philanthropist who funds the Open Society Foundations, could be in his sights. He also identified Reid Hoffman, a billionaire venture capitalist, adding: “I hear about him. Maybe it could be him. It could be a lot of people.” Earlier, the Open Society Foundations had hit back at reports that the justice department was planning to target the group and criticized the Trump administration for “politically motivated attacks on civil society”. Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a statement: “After one of the most harrowing weeks for our first amendment rights, the president is invoking political violence, which we all condemn, as an excuse to target non-profits and activists with the false and stigmatizing label of ‘domestic terrorism’. This is a shameful and dangerous move.” At a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, the memorandum was presented as aimed at “establishing a comprehensive strategy to investigate, disrupt and dismantle all stages of organized political violence and domestic terrorism”. It was said to be part of an administration-wide response that would include the FBI’s joint terrorism taskforces, the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury. Donald Trump on Thursday announced a new round of punishing tariffs, saying the United States will impose a 100% tariffs on imported branded drugs, 25% tariff on imports of all heavy-duty trucks and 50% tariffs on kitchen cabinets. The US president also said he would start charging a 50% tariff on bathroom vanities and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture next week, with all the new duties to take effect from 1 October. Drug companies warned earlier this year that Americans would suffer the most if Trump decided to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals. In 2024, the US imported nearly $233bn in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shock waves to voters as healthcare expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase. Pascal Chan, vice-president for strategic policy and supply chains at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that the tariffs could harm Americans’ health with “immediate price hikes, strained insurance systems, hospital shortages, and the real risk of patients rationing or foregoing essential medicines”. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with the news that James Comey, the former FBI director and one of Donald Trump’s most frequent targets, was indicted on Thursday on one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding, the latest move in the president’s retribution campaign against his political adversaries. The indictment, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, shows Comey’s charges centred on whether he lied and misled lawmakers during testimony in September 2020 about the Russia investigation. Comey was expected to surrender and have his initial appearance in federal district court on Friday morning, according to a person familiar with the matter. Comey is expected to be represented by Patrick Fitzgerald, a former US attorney for the northern district of Illinois. While the precise details were not clear in the sparse, two-page indictment, it appeared to reference Comey’s testimony that he had never authorized someone at the FBI to leak to the news media about the Trump or Hillary Clinton investigations – a claim prosecutors alleged was false. “No one is above the law. Today’s indictment reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people,” Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, said in a statement on Thursday. The indictment followed Trump’s instruction to Bondi to “move now” to prosecute Comey and other officials he considers political foes, in an impatient and extraordinarily direct social media post trampling on the justice department’s tradition of independence. It also came less than a week after Lindsey Halligan was installed as the top federal prosecutor in the eastern district of Virginia, after Trump fired her predecessor, Erik Siebert, after he declined to bring charges against Comey over concerns there was insufficient evidence. Halligan, most recently a White House aide and former Trump lawyer who has no prosecutorial experience, was also presented with a memo earlier this week laying out why charges should not be brought. But the justice department still pushed it through, people familiar with the matter said. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the US senate intelligence committee, said: Donald Trump has made clear that he intends to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics. Responding to the indictment, hours after it was filed, Comey said in a video statement posted on Instagram that he was innocent and welcomed a trial. “My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn’t imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn’t either,” Comey said. Read the full story here: In other developments: Authorities said on Thursday that the words of the suspect in the shooting on Wednesday at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in Texas were “definitively anti-Ice” but said that they did not find evidence that the suspect was a member of “any specific group or entity, nor did he mention any specific government agency other than Ice”.

A Microsoft survey of nearly 1,500 UK senior leaders across public and private sectors, as well as 1,440 employees, found that more than half of executives feel their organisation has no official AI plan. Roughly the same proportion report a growing gap in productivity – a measure of economic efficiency – between employees who use AI and those who do not. “Some organisations appear to be stuck in neutral, caught in the experimentation phase, rather than in the deployment [of AI],” said Darren Hardman, the tech company’s UK chief executive. Microsoft, the biggest financial backer of the ChatGPT developer, OpenAI, has been pushing AI’s deployment in the workplace through autonomous AI agents – tools that can carry out tasks without human intervention. Early adopters of Microsoft’s Copilot Studio product, which deploys bots, include the blue-chip consulting firm McKinsey, which is using agents to carry out tasks such as scheduling meetings with prospective clients. The Tony Blair Institute, a thinktank, has estimated AI could displace up to 3m jobs in the UK, although it expects the net loss to be in the low hundreds of thousands as the technology creates new roles. Speaking to the Guardian, Hardman said AI agents would remove the “digital drudgery” of people’s jobs and allow them to focus on the “creative aspects” of their jobs, potentially creating new roles as the first wave of the internet did for the retail sector. Referring to the creation of new roles in retail such as data analysts, web designers and social media managers, he said: “The nature of that industry changed with the onset of the internet. And I think the creation of an agentic workplace is going to do the same.” Hardman said proposed reforms to UK copyright law, which are fiercely opposed by Britain’s creative industries, would provide “wider economic growth for the UK”. He said: “We think it’s going to provide clarity. We think it’s going to support AI development.” The UK government is proposing to allow tech companies such as Microsoft to use copyright-protected work without permission in order to train their models. Critics of the proposals have described them as a “wholesale” transfer of wealth from the creative industries to the tech sector. Separately, the former chief executive of BP Bernard Looney has been appointed the chair of the UK technology startup ExpectAI. Looney left the oil and gas company in 2023 after admitting he had failed to fully disclose a series of personal relationships with his colleagues to the board. He has been appointed to help accelerate the expansion of ExpectAI, which uses data to help small and medium-sized businesses cut costs and reduce emissions.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft"}

The analysis, conducted on behalf of the Greens, found in 2022-23 Google made $8.7bn across advertising and cloud services, Microsoft made $2.9bn, Meta made $1.3bn and Amazon made close to $6bn across its range of services. Under the Greens’ policy proposal, revenue in excess of $20m earned from digital services in Australia would be taxed at a rate of 3%. The platforms would need to be making more than €750m in worldwide revenue to be captured by the policy. The medium-term revenue for the government under this proposal would be $11.5bn, the costing suggested. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The Greens senator and communications spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the funds could be used pay for essential public services such as dental in Medicare and cost-of-living relief. “We know this works overseas and it can work here,” she said. “At least 12 other countries already have a digital services tax including the UK, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, Austria [and] Portugal.” A major hurdle for any proposed tax on US tech companies, however, will be the Trump administration. Last month, Trump quietly released a memorandum to the US Treasury secretary about “defending American companies and innovators from overseas extortion and unfair fines and penalties”, which focuses on tech companies – and specifically named Australia. It warned that countries that “impose a fine, penalty, tax, or other burden that is discriminatory, disproportionate, or designed to transfer significant funds or intellectual property from American companies to the foreign government or the foreign government’s favored domestic entities” would face tariffs and other actions. “In recent years, the gross domestic product of the United States’ digital economy alone, driven by cutting-edge American technology companies, has been bigger than the entire economy of Australia, Canada, or most members of the European Union,” the order states. “Instead of empowering their own workers and economies, foreign governments have increasingly exerted extraterritorial authority over American companies, particularly in the technology sector, hindering these companies’ success and appropriating revenues that should contribute to our nation’s wellbeing, not theirs.” The announcement has already thrown a spanner in the works for the news media bargaining incentive – a tax designed to force social media companies to pay for news – and the Albanese government hasn’t given strong signals the policy will be in place before the election. Guardian Australia understands the opposition has yet to be briefed by the government on the news media bargaining incentive and has not yet settled on a position. In Senate estimates last week, the infrastructure deputy secretary, James Chisholm, said the department was aware of the memorandum and said: “We will continue to engage with the administration and with industry to ensure that our respective digital policies are meeting our objectives.” In regard to trade and tariff policies that could target Australia, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told estimates last week it had taken the former Liberal government “some time” to negotiate carve outs, and the current government would have “an even greater hill to climb” but said there was a “strong case to put to the US administration”. “We’re very conscious of the policies articulated by President Trump and his administration, and there are many avenues which are being utilised, some of which have been outlined today.”", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft"}

The announcement features some of the biggest names from Silicon Valley: the chipmaker Nvidia; the ChatGPT developer, OpenAI; and Microsoft. Big numbers were involved, with Microsoft hailing its $30bn (£22bn) investment as a major commitment to the UK – and adding, in an apparent swipe at its rivals, that it was not making “empty tech promises”. Here is a breakdown of the announcements in the UK-US “tech prosperity deal”, spelling out what is explicitly new in them. Microsoft invests $30bn in UK Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, hailed the “single biggest announcement” in the pact and insisted it was not an empty promise. The $30bn (£22bn) sets out the company’s UK budget over the next four years and refers not just to artificial intelligence infrastructure but also “ongoing operations” across the UK. Microsoft said the number included $15bn in capital expenditure – such as on equipment, land and buildings – for AI and cloud services, areas where datacentres are key components. The other half will go on day-to-day operations such as research, sales and product development. As part of the package, the US company said it would back an already announced project, an AI datacentre in Loughton, Essex, by becoming a core customer of its owner, the UK-based AI infrastructure company Nscale. Smith had criticised the UK in 2023 as being “bad for business” after Microsoft’s takeover of the video games maker Activision was blocked – a move that was later unwound. He told reporters on Tuesday that Microsoft had been “encouraged” by steps taken by the governments of Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, with the latter helping on planning permission and energy access. “We have a more stable opportunity to accelerate investment in the UK,” Smith said. The £22bn is a significant chunk of the £31bn value the UK government placed on the pact, which also includes £5bn of expenditure from Google that the search company described as “additional investment over the next two years”. The Google figure includes capital expenditure, research and development, and related engineering, as well as work at the AI unit Google DeepMind. AI growth zone in north-east England The north-east will host an AI “growth zone”, an area that will receive special support in planning permission and energy provision for hosting AI infrastructure such as datacentres. The government said this could unlock more than 5,000 jobs and bring in £30bn in investment, although this is all hypothetical for now. One of the datacentre sites, Blyth in Northumberland, has already been announced and is receiving £10bn in financial commitment from the US investment firm Blackstone. The other site mentioned, at Cobalt Park in North Tyneside, features a new development: a domestic version of the US “Stargate” datacentre project championed by Trump. Nscale, OpenAI and Nvidia will develop a platform that will deploy OpenAI’s technology in the UK. The idea is that Stargate UK will help develop “sovereign” AI, where cutting-edge technology is developed and used in the UK’s interests. As part of the first phase of Stargate UK, OpenAI will use 8,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), the powerful computer chips that underpin AI tools such as ChatGPT. Cobalt Park will be one of several UK sites under the plan. Nvidia’s £11bn announcement Nvidia, the world’s biggest AI chipmaker, touted an £11bn injection into the UK economy as part of the pact, providing up to 120,000 of its powerful Blackwell GPUs to projects that will be built over the next couple of years in the UK. So, there is a degree of overlap with other announcements in the pact. Clarifying its investment on Wednesday, Nvidia said the £11bn referred to the total “end-to-end value” its partners were delivering, encompassing the chips they have bought from Nvidia, land and buildings involved in constructing the datacentres, and supercomputers that will house the GPUs. Nvidia, at $4tn the biggest company in the world’s biggest economy, is also investing £500m in Nscale. Other announcements CoreWeave, a US datacentre company, said it would invest a further £1.5bn in the UK including a site in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The US software company Salesforce is investing an additional $2bn in the UK, adding two years to a financial commitment to the UK that will now run to 2030. Nvidia will also invest an undisclosed amount in the UK’s AI startup scene. Tech-boss influx The pact, and Trump’s visit, is being accompanied by an entourage of US tech bosses, with the chief executives of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI travelling across the Atlantic to symbolically reinforce their ties to the US president. Since Trump has been in power, US tech leaders have lined up to express loyalty and support for him and this is another opportunity to do so – as well as to support the projection of US leadership in AI. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is also reportedly attending Wednesday’s state banquet. AI and energy The government claims that the US-UK agreement will “turbocharge” the UK’s low-carbon economy by encouraging the build-out of new nuclear power stations to power the datacentres and supercomputers that underpin the technology. Specifically, the tech pact is expected to bring forward multibillion-pound investments in new nuclear technologies, which would create thousands of jobs under a string of separate transatlantic agreements revealed earlier this week. These new pledges build on Starmer’s existing plan for a once-in-a-generation nuclear expansion that he revealed earlier this year alongside an open invitation to tech companies such as Google, Meta and Amazon to invest in AI datacentres in Britain, which could be powered by small modular reactors. Growing the UK’s low-carbon energy supplies is considered essential if it hopes to host the energy-hungry datacentres required for an AI industry while staying within its net zero carbon budgets. But it will need to add enough new low-carbon energy generation to match the needs of the datacentres, as well as the growing demand for electricity from the rest of the economy, if it hopes to avoid adding extra gas power to the energy system in the future. Many global tech companies, which are also under pressure to satisfy their own carbon-cutting commitments, are turning to nuclear power because reactors generate electricity at a steady rate, which mirrors the energy use of a datacentre. This summer, Meta signed a 20-year deal with a nuclear power station in Illinois, while Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy in the race for AI dominance. Still, the latest AI plans are likely to raise further questions over the UK’s under-pressure water supplies – which are needed to cool down some energy-intensive datacentres.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft"}

The Surface Laptop 13in joins the current seventh-generation Laptop 13.8in and 15in that were launched in the summer last year. It sits at the bottom of the premium pile in price, costing from £899 (€1,099/$900/A$1,699), but above the Laptop Go 3, which is likely to be phased out. The new 13in model looks like a cross between the Laptop Go and its bigger siblings. It has a similar but smaller glossy LCD touchscreen, which isn’t quite as bright or crisp and has a slower 60Hz refresh rate, but still looks good for the size. The smooth aluminium deck holds a full-size keyboard that offers a quality typing experience few competitors manage. The generous trackpad is smooth and precise but of the older, hinged variety, instead of the better haptic models fitted to the larger Surface Laptop models and other premium competitors. It still works fine but is harder to click higher up on the pad. The speakers in the deck are great for the size and the 1080p webcam above the screen is solid, even if it lacks Microsoft’s Windows Hello facial recognition for logging into the machine. Specifications Screen: 13in LCD 1920 x 1280 (178 PPI) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8 core) RAM: 16GB Storage: 256 or 512GB Operating system: Windows 11 Home Camera: 1080P front-facing Connectivity: wifi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, USB-A, 2xUSB-C (3.2), headphones Dimensions: 285.7 x 214.1 x 15.6mm Weight: 1.2kg Snapdragon X Plus The Laptop 13in has Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon X Plus Arm chip with eight cores (versus 10 on the larger models). It won’t win any raw performance awards but it is roughly on a par with its Intel competition and plenty fast enough for a laptop of this size. It stays quiet unless really pushed and feels snappy in operation while managing to be efficient on battery for general use. It lasts a very good 14 hours of work using plenty of browser tabs, multiple chat apps, text editors and note-taking apps. That is almost twice as long as previous Intel-based Surface Laptops and much more on a par with Apple’s class-leading MacBook Air. Using it for more demanding tasks, such as large photo editing or other creative applications, cuts the battery life roughly in half for a still solid seven hours. The Surface has two USB-C (3.2) ports and a USB-A port, which is reasonably good for a machine of this size. But it lacks the more modern USB4/Thunderbolt and ditches Microsoft’s proprietary Surface Connect port, relying instead on USB-C for charging, which is no bad thing unless you already own a Surface Dock or similar accessory. Windows 11 on Arm The Surface runs Windows 11, which generally works well without any unnecessary trials and bits of software that frequently plague rivals. But Windows on Arm chips, such as the Surface’s Snapdragon models, still has a few compatibility problems not shared by the version running on the standard x86 chips from Intel or AMD. Apps that aren’t written for Arm systems have to be run through an emulation system, which works in the background but makes them much slower. Lighter-weight x86 apps, such as the note-taker Evernote, work OK but are noticeably slower than on Arm-native rivals. The majority of popular apps now have Arm versions, which fly along. That includes Google Drive, which until recently was incompatible with Windows on Arm. But there are enough apps with issues, particularly in the creative industries, that you should check for problems before buying. Gaming is also tricky, as most big games including Fortnite are not compatible with Arm chips. The laptop is a Copilot+PC and includes Microsoft’s various AI tools. The much-delayed Recall feature records snapshots of what you’re doing on the machine so you can use it like a time machine to see what was on screen at any particular moment. You can search Recall using natural language and interact with the text, images or data it finds, such as opening a site you were browsing a couple of days ago. It is an opt-in feature, the screenshots are stored locally on your device secured by your fingerprint, and you can block some apps from being captured, such as a password manager, but it could still be a privacy risk too far for some. The rest of the AI tools are similar to those on previous Surfaces, including a Cocreator system in Paint that can turn crude sketches into art. The most powerful tool is Copilot, which is integrated across multiple Microsoft apps, including Word and other members of the Office suite if you have a subscription. Generally it works as a cross between a search tool and an AI chatbot, and makes short work of turning data into tables, jazzing up your copy or identifying things from images, though you have to use Microsoft’s Edge browser for it to be able to see what you’re looking at on your screen. Microsoft’s new “Click to Do” feature allows you to hold the Windows button and click on something on your screen to perform actions with it, such as remove an image’s background with Paint or rewrite the text with AI. It is fairly basic at the moment, with more features to be added later this year, but it works as a much quicker and accessible way of performing AI tasks with things on a PC. Sustainability The laptop is generally repairable, with a replaceable SSD, spare parts, self-repair and service guides available. The machine contains recycled cobalt and rare earth metals. Microsoft operates trade-in and recycling schemes and publishes out-of-warranty repair costs and product environmental impact reports. Price The Microsoft Surface Laptop 13in costs from £899 (€1,099/$899.99/A$1,699) and ships on 10 June. For comparison, the Surface Laptop 13.8in costs from £944, the Surface Pro 12in costs £799, the Surface Pro 13in costs £1,029 and the 13in MacBook Air M4 costs £999. Verdict The Surface Laptop 13in is a smaller, cut-down version of Microsoft’s excellent Windows 11 laptop. The general feel of the machine is very similar to its larger siblings thanks to premium materials, a great keyboard and clutter-free Windows 11 experience. The 13in touchscreen is decent, if not quite as good as other models, and the older-technology trackpad still works well. Microsoft’s AI tools are slowly improving, though they are still not a reason to buy a machine. The lack of USB4/Thunderbolt and face recognition can be overlooked for a cheaper price, as can the lower-power chip. It proved more than fast enough for general productivity, and helps provide long battery life that could see out two full work days between charges. The Arm chip brings with it some potential app compatibility problems that are worth checking out before buying. Overall, the small Surface Laptop is a lovely machine. But at £900 or equivalent it’s not terribly cheap, with its larger and better sibling often available for similar money, so it’s worth shopping around. Pros: good keyboard, decent trackpad, good speakers, USB-A and USB-C, decent screen, fingerprint reader, long battery life, solid performance, clutter-free Windows 11 with AI features. Cons: app and game compatibility issues with Arm chip, screen only 60Hz and less crisp than larger siblings, no face recognition, no USB4, no haptic touchpad, a little expensive.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft"}

Figures for September suggest four in 10 of those using Microsoft Windows worldwide were still using Windows 10, despite the introduction of its successor, Windows 11, in 2021. What is happening to Windows 10? After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide standard free software updates, security fixes or technical assistance to Windows 10 PCs. This means computers running the software will still work but it will steadily become more vulnerable to viruses and malware as bugs and security holes are discovered. Microsoft says the more up-to-date system, Windows 11, “meets the current demands for heightened security by default”. What’s the risk? If Windows users do nothing, they could become particularly vulnerable to hackers who are attracted to wide-scale systemic weaknesses. The consumer group Which? warned that about 5 million British computer users plan to continue using devices running the software. Wherever in the world you are, by continuing to use Windows 10 you will put yourself at risk of cyber-attacks, data theft and scams. Criminals “are going to target people, they are going to exploit weaknesses and they are going to want to steal your data,” says Lisa Barber, the editor of Which? Tech magazine. How do I reduce the threat? The most straightforward move is to update to Windows 11 for free. If your PC is less than four years old it will probably be able to run Windows 11. To find out, check your computer specifications. The minimum specifications for Windows 11 are 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but computers also need a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM 2.0), which stores credentials in a secure chip, similar to all modern smartphones. Microsoft has a free tool to check whether a computer running Windows 10 will support Windows 11 and Which? has an online tool to check compatibility based on the processor in your computer. What if my computer lacks the necessary hardware to upgrade to Windows 11? Doing nothing could leave you vulnerable to malware and other security breaches. One option is to sign up for Microsoft’s one-year extended security update, which will ensure protection until 13 October 2026. That will give you another year to plan for the end of support and make alternative arrangements. Signing up is free if you log into Windows 10 with a Microsoft account to sync your settings, otherwise you will need to pay $30, plus tax, or redeem 1,000 reward points. Is there an alternative to Windows 11? Other computer operating systems can provide safe and secure use for PCs that cannot upgrade to Windows 11. One solution is to install Linux, which is a family of free operating systems that come in various flavours or “distributions”. Make sure you back up all your files to an external drive or similar safe storage, as replacing Windows is likely to wipe them or make them hard to access. One of the most popular and user-friendly versions of Linux is Canonical’s Ubuntu, which is free, open source and supported with security updates. You will need a USB flash drive to install it in place of Windows, but Canonical has a step-by-step guide you can follow. Bear in mind that while plenty of software supports Linux, not all Windows apps will have Linux versions. Alternatively, if most of what you need a computer for can be performed using a browser, Google offers a version of its lightweight ChromeOS that can be installed on a number of PCs for free. Check that your model is supported and then follow Google’s ChromeOS Flex installation guide. You will need a USB flash drive. Buy a new computer If your computer cannot install alternative software or you need Windows, then another alternative is simply to buy a new PC with Windows 11 and support. Many retailers operate trade-in schemes that take back your old computer for recycling and offer a small discount on new models. Alternatively, refurbished Windows 11 machines are widely available from various retailers, such as Currys, marketplaces such as Back Market and manufacturers, such as Dell for lower cost.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft"}

Tech companies", "date": null, "author": "Dara Kerr", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "Donald Trump’s AI summit in Washington this week was a fanfare-filled event catered to the tech elite. The president took the stage on Wednesday evening, as the song God Bless the USA piped over the loudspeakers, and then he decreed: “America must once again be a country where innovators are rewarded with a green light, not strangled with red tape, so they can’t move, so they can’t breathe.” The message was clear – the tech regulatory environment that was once the focus of federal lawmakers is no longer. “I’ve been watching for many years,” Trump continued. “I’ve watched regulation. I’ve been a victim of regulation.” As Trump spoke to the crowd, he addressed them as “the group of smart ones … the brain power”. In front of him were tech leaders, venture capitalists and billionaires, including Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang and Palantir’s chief technology officer Shyam Sankar. The Hill and Valley Forum, an influential tech industry interest group, co-hosted the confab, along with the Silicon Valley All-in Podcast, which is hosted by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks. Dubbed “Winning the AI Race”, the forum was an opportunity for the president to deliver what he called the “AI action plan”, which aims to loosen restrictions on the development and deployment of artificial intelligence. The cornerstone of that plan are three executive orders that Trump said will turn the US into an “AI export powerhouse” and roll back some of the rules put in place by the Biden administration, which included guardrails around safe and secure AI development. “Winning the AI race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in Silicon Valley – and long beyond Silicon Valley,” Trump said. One executive order targets what the White House calls “woke” AI and requires any company receiving federal funding to maintain AI models free from “ideological dogmas such as DEI”. But the other two focus on deregulation, a major demand of American tech leaders who have taken an increasingly bullish stand on government oversight. One of those promotes the export of “American AI” to other countries and the other eases environmental rules and expedites federal permitting for power-hungry data centers. Millions in lobbying To get to this moment, tech companies have been forging a friendly relationship with Trump. The CEOs of Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Apple donated to the president’s inauguration fund and met with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, has become a close ally of Trump, and Nvidia’s Huang has also cozied up with the president with promises of investing $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years. “The reality is that big tech companies are still spending tens of millions of dollars to curry favor with lawmakers and shape tech legislation,” said Alix Fraser, the vice-president of advocacy for the nonprofit Issue One. In a report released on Tuesday, Issue One looked at lobbying spending in 2025 and found that the tech industry has spent record-breaking sums. Eight of the largest tech companies spent a combined $36m – that’s an average of about $320,000 per day when Congress is in session, according to Issue One. Meta spent the most, $13.8m, and has hired 86 lobbyists this year, according to the report. And Nvidia and OpenAI saw the biggest increases, with Nvidia spending 388% more than the same time last year, and OpenAI spending 44% more. In the lead-up to Trump’s unveiling of his AI plan, more than 100 prominent labor, environmental, civil rights and academic groups countered the president and signed a “People’s AI action plan”. In a statement, the groups stressed the need for “relief from the tech monopolies” that they say “sacrifice the interests of everyday people for their own profits”. “We can’t let big tech and big oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families’ wellbeing, even the air we breathe and the water we drink – all of which are affected by the unrestrained and unaccountable rollout of AI,” the groups wrote. Meanwhile, tech companies and industry groups celebrated the executive orders. Microsoft, IBM, Dell, Meta, Palantir, Nvidia, Anthropic, xAI and others praised the plan. James Czerniawski, the head of emerging technology policy at the Consumer Choice Center, a pro-business lobbying group, heralded Trump’s AI plan as a “bold vision”. “This is a world of difference from the hostile regulatory approach of the Biden administration,” Czerniawski concluded.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft"}

One in four of an estimated 21 million UK people using a device that runs the Windows 10 software intend to continue using it after updates cease and so will be at risk of online security breaches including malware and viruses, according to a survey by Which? More than a third of those who are not planning to take action and therefore risk becoming vulnerable are people aged over 55. The move is also predicted to add to the e-waste mountain with millions of PCs worldwide predicted to become obsolete if they cannot be updated and many customers taking the opportunity to buy new hardware. Microsoft is encouraging consumers to use recycling initiatives. The issue affects hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses using Windows 10 globally. Industry estimates suggest as many as 13% of computers currently running the software will need to be replaced. For the other devices, the solution is relatively simple and involves upgrading to Windows 11 if a PC supports it. Alternatively Microsoft is offering a one-year extension to Windows 10 to give users time to assess alternatives. But the survey by Which? found that while 39% of current users would update their Windows package, 26% said they intended to continue using version 10 after updates ceased. “Millions of people may be unprepared for the phasing out of Windows 10 next week,” said Lisa Barber, the editor of Which? Tech magazine. “If you have a home laptop or PC running Windows, now is the time to check which version you’re using and if it’s Windows 10 or older, make a plan of action. If you don’t act, you could become more vulnerable to hackers and scams.” In a blog, Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive vice-president, said that after security and feature updates and technical support for Windows 10 PCs stopped, devices would be “more vulnerable to cyber-threats, such as malware and viruses.” “Applications running on Windows 10 may no longer be supported, as the platform is no longer receiving feature updates,” he said. “As a result, some apps may experience decreased functionality.” What is happening to Windows 10? After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide software updates, security fixes or technical assistance to Windows 10 PCs.

{"id": "games/2025/aug/27/keeper-ecological-fever-dream-where-you-play-as-a-lighthouse", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/aug/27/keeper-ecological-fever-dream-where-you-play-as-a-lighthouse", "title": "Keeper is the ecological ‘fever dream’ where you play as – checks notes – a lighthouse", "date": null, "author": "Lewis Gordon", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "Keeper is staking a bold claim to be the oddest game ever published by Microsoft. The setting is weird: an iridescent, far-future imagining of New England where organic and non-organic matter mingle in strange, alchemical ways. And the characters are undeniably quirky: one is a bird called Twig whose beak is made from driftwood. Strangest of all: you play as a lighthouse that has inexplicably become animate, sprouting tiny, spindly little legs to carry its wibbling, wobbling body. In the sea of action-hero young men and, to a lesser degree, women, the lighthouse stands out as an unlikely star. Creative lead Lee Petty is a little fuzzy on the details of how it came to be. Rather, he talks about the creation of the protagonist as he does the broader action-adventure experience: as if it rose out of his subconscious. Despite the ostensible absurdity, Petty believes there is a certain intuition about it. “You have a light, and light has a very strong connection with life,” he says. “You can imagine the verbs for the player, and the actions, puzzles, mechanics that fall out of that.” The lighthouse’s illuminated beacon is the primary way you interact with the game’s teeming island setting. In “unfocused” mode, you direct the beam about a fantastical environment, causing foliage and small creatures to grow, change and morph. In “focused” mode, the light’s power is concentrated: larger objects undergo transformation while some materials are repelled or attracted; this is the basis of the game’s more involved puzzles. Keeper’s world is one of gauzy, psychedelic purples and deep, verdant greens. We see bioluminescent rock formations, tree-sized tendrils protruding from their gigantic flower heads, and a gorgeous, whale-like creature floating through the sky, vegetation growing unexpectedly on its back. This ecological extravaganza is partly inspired by 1980s fantasy movies such as The Dark Crystal and The NeverEnding Story, “weird” and “imperfect” works, admits Petty, yet “so earnest in their desire to create a world that you haven’t seen before”. Real life proved just as inspiring for the creative lead. During Covid lockdowns, he walked alone in the pretty foothills south of his San Francisco home. Petty gazed at the abundant vegetation while meditating on what the planet might look like should humanity cease to exist. He was also reading books and watching movies about mycelium networks, thinking deeply about the interconnectedness and interdependence of ecosystems. This deluge of feelings, real-world circumstances and reference material coalesced as a fever dream, says Petty. He envisioned a “a weird island, a sort of surreal, post-human thing, where life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways”. The game’s genesis arrived shortly after Petty’s award-winning employer Double Fine, maker of trippy platformer Psychonauts 2, Stacking and many other idiosyncratic titles, was acquired by Microsoft. The new management was receptive to his experimental idea: he was given the time and resources to explore the concept before locking down its form. Keeper seems to have embodied the laid-back approach of its making: the vibe is languorously dreamy with many opportunities to slow down and smell the enchanting and totally bizarre roses. “You’re not rushed along, you’re not given mission objectives. There are no pop-ups on the screen with meta-rewards,” says Petty. “You’re kind of left to dwell in the space.” And yet there is a grim irony that may yet sour this sweet, whimsical experience: Keeper’s vivid celebration of life is being funded by Microsoft at a time when the company’s cloud-based storage platform Azure has been used to facilitate the preparation of deadly airstrikes and military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has called for the boycott of Microsoft and Xbox products. Recently, unionised workers at French studio Arkane, also owned by Microsoft, issued an open letter stating that its parent company “has no place being accomplice of a genocide”. Microsoft has since announced that it is investigating the use of its platform in this manner, which it states is a breach of the terms of service. Petty, of course, is far removed from the decisions made by his bosses at Microsoft, and he stresses as much. He says this is the “downside” of being owned by a much larger organisation, one whose purview extends far beyond entertainment. “I’m not in control. Double Fine is not necessarily tacitly endorsing anything of our parent company,” he says. “We’re just trying to make great games.” • Keeper is due for release on PC and Xbox in October • This article was amended on 29 August 2025 to clarify that Microsoft is investigating the use of its Azure technology by the Israeli Defence Forces.", "section": "Games", "query": "Microsoft"}

With Donald Trump pledging to support them, the three technology giants are planning hundreds of datacentres in the US and across the globe, with a potentially huge impact on populations already living with water scarcity. “The question of water is going to become crucial,” said Lorena Jaume-Palasí, founder of the Ethical Tech Society. “Resilience from a resource perspective is going to be very difficult for those communities.” Efforts by Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, to mitigate its water use have sparked opposition from inside the company, SourceMaterial’s investigation found, with one of its own sustainability experts warning that its plans are “not ethical”. In response to questions from SourceMaterial and the Guardian, spokespeople for Amazon and Google defended their developments, saying they always take water scarcity into account. Microsoft declined to provide a comment. Datacentres, vast warehouses containing networked servers used for the remote storage and processing of data, as well as by information technology companies to train AI models such as ChatGPT, use water for cooling. SourceMaterial’s analysis identified 38 active datacentres owned by the big three tech firms in parts of the world already facing water scarcity, as well as 24 more under development. Datacentres’ locations are often industry secrets. But by using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel and Data Center Map, SourceMaterial compiled a map of 632 datacentres – either active or under development – owned by Amazon, Microsoft and Google. It shows that those companies’ plans involve a 78% increase in the number of datacentres they own worldwide as cloud computing and AI cause a surge in the world’s demand for storage, with construction planned in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. In parts of the world where water is plentiful, datacentres’ high water usage is less problematic, but in 2023 Microsoft said that 42% of its water came from “areas with water stress”, while Google said 15% of its water consumption was in areas with “high water scarcity”. Amazon did not report a figure. Now these companies plan to expand their activities in some of the world’s most arid regions, SourceMaterial and the Guardian’s analysis found. “It’s no coincidence they are building in dry areas,” as datacentres have to be built inland, where low humidity reduces the risk of metal corrosion, while seawater also causes corrosion if used for cooling, Jaume-Palasí said. ‘Your cloud is drying my river’ Amazon’s three proposed new datacentres in the Aragon region of northern Spain – each next to an existing Amazon datacentre – are licensed to use an estimated 755,720 cubic metres of water a year, roughly enough to irrigate 233 hectares (576 acres) of corn, one of the region’s main crops. In practice, the water usage will be even higher as that figure doesn’t take into account water used to generate the electricity that will power the new installations, said Aaron Wemhoff, an energy efficiency specialist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. Between them, Amazon’s new datacentres in the Aragon region are predicted to use more electricity than the entire region currently consumes. Meanwhile, Amazon in December asked the regional government for permission to increase water consumption at its three existing datacentres by 48%. Opponents have accused the company of being undemocratic by trying to rush through its application over the Christmas period. More water is needed because “climate change will lead to an increase in global temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events, including heat waves”, Amazon wrote in its application. “They’re using too much water. They’re using too much energy,” said Aurora Gómez of the campaign group Tu Nube Seca Mi Río – Spanish for “Your cloud is drying my river” – which has called for a moratorium on new datacentres in Spain due to water scarcity. Spain has seen rising numbers of heat-related deaths in extreme weather events linked by scientists to the climate crisis. Last month, Aragon’s government asked for EU aid to tackle its drought. Farmer Chechu Sánchez said he’s worried the datacentres will use up water he needs for his crops. “These datacentres use water that comes from northern Aragon, where I am,” he said. “They consume water – where do they take it from? They take it from you, of course.” With 75% of the country already at risk of desertification, the combination of the climate crisis and datacentre expansion is “bringing Spain to the verge of ecological collapse”, Jaume-Palasí said. Asked about the decision to approve more datacentres, a spokesperson for the Aragonese government said they would not compromise the region’s water resources because their impact is “imperceptible”. Water offsetting Amazon does not provide overall figures for the water its datacentres use worldwide. But it does claim that it will be “water positive” by 2030, offsetting its consumption by providing water to communities and ecosystems in areas of scarcity elsewhere. Amazon says it is currently offsetting 41% of its water usage in areas it deems unsustainable. But it’s an approach that has already caused controversy inside the company. “I raised the issue in all the right places that this is not ethical,” said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at Amazon. “I disagreed quite a lot with that principle coming from a pure sustainability background.” Microsoft and Google have also pledged to become “water positive” by 2030 through water offsetting, as well as finding ways to use water more efficiently. Water offsetting ca not work in the same way as carbon offsetting, where a tonne of pollutants removed from the atmosphere can cancel out a tonne emitted elsewhere, said Wemhoff, the Villanova University specialist. Improving access to water in one area does nothing to help the community that has lost access to it far away. “Carbon is a global problem – water is more localised,” he said. Amazon should pursue water accessibility projects “because it’s the right thing to do”, not to offset the company’s usage and make claims about being “water positive”, Wangusi said. In March, Amazon announced that it would use AI to help farmers in Aragon use water more efficiently. But that is “a deliberate strategy of obfuscation” that distracts from the company’s request to raise water consumption, said Gómez, the campaigner. Amazon said its approach shouldn’t be described as offsetting because the projects are in communities where the company operates. “We know that water is a precious resource, and we’re committed to doing our part to help solve this challenge,” said Harry Staight, an Amazon spokesperson. “It’s important to remember many of our facilities do not require the ongoing use of water to cool operations.” ‘Extreme drought’ Amazon is by far the biggest owner of datacentres in the world by dint of its Amazon Web Services cloud division, but Google and Microsoft are catching up. In the US, which boasts the largest number of datacentres in the world, Google is the most likely to build in dry areas, SourceMaterial’s data shows. It has seven active datacentres in parts of the US facing water scarcity and is building six more. “We have to be very, very protective around the growth of large water users,” said Jenn Duff, a council member in Mesa, Arizona, a fast-growing datacentre hub. In January, Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, opened a $1bn datacentre in the city, and Google is developing two more. The surrounding Maricopa county, where Microsoft also has two active datacentres, is facing “extreme drought”, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In June 2023, Arizona state officials revoked construction permits for some new homes there due to a lack of groundwater. Drought has not halted Google’s plans for a second Mesa datacentre, while its first centre has a permit to use 5.5m cubic metres of water a year – about the same quantity used by 23,000 ordinary Arizonans. “Is the increase in tax revenue and the relatively paltry number of jobs worth the water?” said Kathryn Sorensen, an Arizona State University professor and a former director of Mesa’s water department. “It is incumbent on city councils to think very carefully and examine the trade-offs.” Google said it won’t use the full amount of water in its Mesa permit as it plans to use an air cooling system. “Cooling systems are a hyperlocal decision – informed by our data-driven strategy called ‘climate-conscious cooling’ that balances the availability of carbon-free energy and responsibly sourced water to minimise climate impact both today and in the future,” said Google spokesperson Chris Mussett. Stargate In January at the White House, Trump announced “Project Stargate”, which he called “the largest AI infrastructure project in history”. Starting in Texas, the $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, the American software company Oracle, Japan-based SoftBank and Emirati investment firm MGX will finance datacentres across the US. The day before the Stargate announcement, Trump’s inauguration date, the Chinese company DeepSeek launched its own AI model, claiming it had used far less computing power – and therefore less water – than its western rivals. More recently, Bloomberg has reported that Microsoft is pulling back on some of its plans for new datacentres around the world. Microsoft has also published plans for a “zero water” datacentre, and Google has said it will incorporate air cooling to reduce water use – though it isn’t yet clear how its systems will work. “I’ll believe it when I see it,” said Jaume-Palasí. “Most datacentres right now are going from air cooling to water cooling because liquid is more efficient when you try to cool down high-density racks, which are the ones that are mostly being used for AI.” And while the Trump administration has pledged to fast-track new energy projects to power these new datacentres, it has so far said nothing about the water they could use up. “Neither people nor data can live without water,” said Gómez. “But human life is essential and data isn’t.” Additional reporting by Eleanor Gunn", "section": "Environment", "query": "Microsoft"}

Often relegated to less exciting regions of the fruit bowl, they actually come in a dizzying array of varieties – sharp, sweet, floral, crisp – and each with their own quirks. And now is the time to celebrate apples, so this week I’m giving them the attention they deserve in a no-bake toffee apple pie (banoffee’s autumn cousin) and a soft, cinnamon-spiced crumb cake. Toffee apple pie (pictured top) You will need a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 10 min Chill 2 hr+ Serves 8-10 For the case 275g digestive biscuits ¼ tsp fine sea salt 1 tsp ground cinnamon 140g unsalted butter, melted For the caramelised apples 500g apples, I used braeburn, but pink lady work well, too 70g caster sugar 30g butter 1 tsp lemon juice For the sour cream whip 50g sour cream 250ml double cream 25g caster sugar To assemble 397g tin dulce de leche (I used Carnation) 25g roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped For the biscuit base, blitz or bash the digestives into fine crumbs. Mix in the salt and cinnamon, then pour in the melted butter and mix well until it has the texture of very wet sand and clumps together when you give it a gentle squeeze. Press evenly into a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin (put a disc of baking paper on the base for an easier release later), starting with the edges and working your way into the base. Put the tin in the fridge to firm up. Meanwhile, peel and core the apples, then cut them into even slices, about 1cm wide (you should have about 400g). In a low, wide frying pan, add the caster sugar and heat over a medium-high heat until it starts to melt, caramelise, and even burn in places – three to four minutes. Add the butter and apples, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mixture come to a bubble. Lower the heat, then simmer the apples in the juices for about 10 minutes, or until tender. (Depending on the variety, you might get a mixture of mushier and firmer pieces.) Stir in the lemon juice, then remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool. To assemble, beat the dulce de leche until smooth, then spread evenly over the biscuit base. Arrange the apple slices (avoiding the juices) on top in slightly overlapping concentric circles and in a single layer. Reserve the apple caramel juices for finishing the tart. Whip all the ingredients for the sour cream whip together until you get soft peaks. Pile the cream on top of the apples, giving it a pleasing swoop. Arrange the hazelnuts on top, then finish with drizzles of the caramelised apple juices. Chill for two to three hours before serving. Apple crumb loaf Prep 5 min Cook 1 hr 10 min Serves 6-8 You will need a 21.5cm x 11.5cm x 6cm loaf pan. For the cake 2 medium-sized eating apples 1½ tsp cinnamon 150g unsalted butter 75g caster sugar 100g light brown sugar 2 eggs, about 100g 1 tsp vanilla extract 150g plain flour 50g wholemeal flour 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (6g) ¼ tsp fine salt For the crumb 40g light brown sugar 60g plain flour A pinch of salt 30g oats 40g butter, melted Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Halve and core one apple (no need to peel), then cut it into 2mm slices (you should get about 120-130g). Toss with the cinnamon in a bowl and set aside. Grate the other apple on the coarse side of a box grater – you need about 100g. For the cake, cream the butter and sugars for about two minutes until slightly pale and about one and a half times their original volume. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition, followed by the grated apple and vanilla extract. Stir through the dry ingredients to form a batter. Line the loaf tin with baking paper, then spoon in about 80% of the mixture. Arrange the thinly sliced cinnamon apples on top in overlapping layers, then top with the remaining mixture, smoothing the top. Bake for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the crumb. Mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl (you can use the cinnamon apple bowl for less washing up!), then pour in the melted butter and mix again until a crumb forms. Carefully remove the cake from the oven and sprinkle the oat crumb all over the top. Return to the oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Leave to cool completely in the tin before serving.

Dense yet tender, plush with fruit and rich with toffee, it’s simple enough for a weekend pudding, and special enough to be served at a gathering. Toffee apple pudding cake Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Cool 30 min+ Serves 8 125g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra, softened, for greasing 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 small apples, preferably granny smith 150g small, firm dried figs, chopped into roughly 1cm pieces 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 2 tsp baking powder ½ tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp fine sea salt 200g light muscovado sugar 1 large egg 1 tsp vanilla extract For the toffee apple topping 3 small apples, preferably granny smith 100g unsalted butter 100g light brown muscovado sugar 1 tsp lemon juice 100ml double cream ¼ tsp flaky sea salt Grease a 23cm bundt tin thoroughly with the extra softened butter, then dust some flour all over the inside. Rotate to coat tin entirely, then turn upside down and tap firmly over a bin to remove the excess flour. Set aside in a cool place. Peel, core and cut the apples into roughly 1cm dice (you will need 200g diced flesh), then place in a medium saucepan. Add the chopped figs and 250ml water, put on a medium heat and bring to a simmer.

Add the egg and vanilla, beat until just combined, then turn down the speed to low and, in alternate batches, add the sifted dry ingredients and the apple-fig mix. Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool for at least 30 minutes, then invert the cake on to a serving plate. Meanwhile, make the toffee apples. Peel, core and quarter the apples, then cut each quarter into four. Put a tablespoon of the butter and two tablespoons of the sugar in a large saute pan, add the apples and lemon juice, then cook, stirring regularly, over a medium heat for eight to 10 minutes, until the apples soften and turn golden. Add the remaining butter and sugar, stir to melt, then add the cream and salt, and stir gently to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for one or two minutes, until thick and glossy. Take off the heat and spoon the apples all over the top of the cake. Serve with cream or creme fraiche. Baking and the Meaning of Life by Helen Goh (Murdoch Books, £26).

That’s because Apple has finally brought one of the best features of modern smartphones to its base-model flagship phone: a super-smooth 120Hz screen. And it has done so, while also doubling the starting storage, without increasing the price. The iPhone 17 still starts at the same £799 (€949/$799/A$1,399) as its predecessor, sitting below the £999 Air and £1,099 Pro, while offering a lot of iPhone for the money. From the outside it doesn’t look as if anything has changed since the iPhone 16, but the 17 is ever so slightly taller to squeeze in the bigger screen with slimmer borders without making the phone materially larger. The 6.3in screen now matches the super-bright display on the 17 Pro covered with significantly toughened glass to better resist scratches. The 120Hz “Pro Motion” tech is the best bit, doubling the refresh rate of the screen to make scrolling and animations much smoother and more responsive. It has been a feature common to rival smartphones for years, but Apple has until this point reserved it for Pro models of the iPhone, MacBooks and iPads. The 17 also has the previously Pro-only always-on display feature, which shows the time, widgets and notifications while the phone is idle. And it runs the same iOS 26 with Apple’s new glass-like interface design as the rest of the iPhone lineup. It looks a bit different and some elements have been simplified or condensed to get out of the way of the content you’re trying to see, but generally it works the same with some nice touches here and there. Specifications Screen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A19 RAM: 8GB Storage: 256 or 512GB Operating system: iOS 26 Camera: 48MP main + 48MP UW; 18MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 149.6 x 71.5 x 7.95mm Weight: 177g Rapid A19 chip and solid battery life The iPhone 17 has Apple’s new A19 chip, which is only a little less powerful than the A19 Pro in the other models this year, making it one of the fastest chips in a smartphone. Apple still has a lead over Android rivals in processors, even in cheaper models. As a result the 17 handles everything you could want to do with a phone with aplomb. Battery life is also good for a phone of this size, lasting a solid 44 hours of mixed usage across wifi and 5G between charges, actively using the screen for about six hours and with the always-on display feature turned on. That’s slightly shorter than its predecessor, but slightly longer than the similarly sized 17 Pro and a fair bit longer than the iPhone Air. Most people will need to charge the 17 every other day. Sustainability The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. The phone contains more than 30% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down its environmental impact in a report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The 17 has two 48-megapixel cameras on the back – one main and one ultrawide – plus Apple’s new 18MP centre stage selfie camera, as seen on the iPhone 17 Pro and Air. The main camera remains unchanged from the iPhone 16 and shoots great photos across a range of lighting conditions. Occasionally it can be blown out by bright lights or suffer from a bit of blur or grain in low-light conditions, but it is a reliably good point-and-shoot camera. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which works great in good light and OK in dimmer indoor lighting. The ultrawide is an upgrade on predecessors, shooting with greater detail and range. It works particularly well for the macro mode for closeup photos. The camera can digitally zoom up 10x, but the resulting photos lack detail and sharpness. A real camera zoom is still limited to the Pro models on an iPhone. The new front-facing camera shoots solid selfies, which are slightly better than previous iPhones. But its party piece is the ability to automatically pan and zoom to fit everyone in for group shots, no matter which orientation you hold the phone. Shooting landscape photos while holding your phone in portrait is surprisingly useful. The 17 has plenty of modes to play about with and shoots great video, including a dual-capture feature that records from the front and back cameras at the same time to put the photographer into the shot in a little window. Price The iPhone 17 starts from £799 (€949/$799/A$1,399) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone Air costs £999, iPhone 17 Pro costs £1,099, the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 costs £799, the Samsung Galaxy S25 costs £699 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499. Verdict The iPhone 17 may not look all that different from last year’s model, but it is a meaningful upgrade on all the standard model iPhones that have come before. That’s because it has key features pulled down from Apple’s pricier Pro models, including a significantly better, brighter and 120Hz-smooth screen. It’s a must-have feature that has been standard on rival phones for years. The always-on display is super handy too, while double the starting storage to 256GB and about two-day battery life is very welcome. For the first time in many years, using the iPhone 17 doesn’t feel like a significant downgrade from the Pro models. The dual camera on the back is good, but the lack of a telephoto option keeps it from being great. The iPhone 17 still feels compact for a modern phone, and while not quite as featherlight as the iPhone Air, it isn’t exactly heavy. Unless you need a camera zoom, the standard iPhone 17 is the one to get for Apple buyers. It’s great. Pros: rapid, great 120Hz screen, good dual camera with macro mode, at least 256GB storage, great size, action and camera control buttons, USB-C, good battery life, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no telephoto camera, samey design, not the thinnest, lightest or most powerful model.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple"}

Fruit and squashes have ripened weeks earlier than normal in many places and yields are higher thanks to near-ideal conditions, including 2024’s wet weather followed by a warm and dry spring and plenty of summer sun this year. It is a stark contrast to last autumn, when wet weather boosted slug and snail numbers, resulting in pumpkin and squash crops being wrecked. The National Trust’s plant health and sustainability consultant, Rebecca Bevan, said: “Climate change has brought us some very challenging growing conditions over recent years with extremes of wet and dry weather and many storms. “It’s heartening that sometimes the conditions lead to good outcomes and fruit harvests are a success story for 2025.” At Cotehele in Cornwall, for example, where its “mother orchard” is home to more than 100 varieties of apple tree, thousands of pieces of fruit have been produced far earlier than expected this year. The head gardener, David Bouch, said: “The warm, mild spring resulted in bountiful blossom and despite the summer’s record-breaking temperatures we have had an amazing crop of apples. “A month ago, I wasn’t overly confident because the fruit was very small which is usually the case in very dry summers, but the apples have swollen quickly over the last couple of weeks thanks to the rain we’ve had.” At Buckland Abbey near Plymouth in Devon, the kitchen garden is overflowing with squash and pumpkins. Its head gardener, Sam Brown, said: “We have about 50% more squash and pumpkins than usual. We’d normally harvest them in mid-October but are about to start now.” In north Wales, a bumper crop of vintage apples, including St Cecilia and King of the Pippins, has been reported this year at Erddig Hall. Its head gardener, Andrew Degg, said: “Usually, we pick about 2 tonnes and this year we are on target for 4 tonnes.” The head gardener at Hughenden in Buckinghamshire, Claire Primett, said: “Typically 40% of the trees fruit each year, but this year it is almost double that.” At The Vyne in Hampshire, a former Tudor palace, the aptly named Frogmore Prolific apple is doing exceptionally well, as are the Autumn Pearmain and Golden Reinette varieties. It has also been a good year for apples and pears in the north of England. At Beningbrough Hall in North Yorkshire its Irish Peach tree normally produces just one or two apples, but this year there have been 40. At Sissinghurst in Kent, heritage pumpkin varieties such as Marina di Chioggia and Rouge Vif d’Etampes are thriving. Its gardener, Olivia Steed-Mundin, said: “They have loved the heat over the summer. Some are already ripe, and they store beautifully for up to six months if cured [hardened] properly. “This can be done by placing them in a dry, sunny and warm environment for a few weeks. A greenhouse or sunny windowsill is ideal. After that they should be stored in dry, coolish conditions for long-term storage.”", "section": "UK news", "query": "Apple"}

Otherwise the new model is a direct replacement for the Series 10, matching it in design, dimensions and features, with most of its upgrades coming from software. That makes it one of the very best smartwatches available, even if it hasn’t changed much. The Series 11 is also £30 cheaper in the UK, costing from £369 (€449/$399/A$679), and sits above the newly revamped £219 Watch SE at the low end and the £749 Ultra 3 at the high end. Like last year’s Series 10, the new model is only 9.7mm thick, which makes it a slim fit to the wrist, easy to sneak under cuffs and more comfortable at night. It is light, slim and easy to live with. The 2,000nit OLED screen is plenty bright for seeing indoors and out, remaining clear to read off-angle, which makes glancing down at the time or notifications easy. It is covered by glass that Apple says is twice as scratch resistant as before, although not as hard as sapphire, which is reserved for the more expensive titanium models. The new watch has the same S10 chip as last year’s model but now supports optional 5G and stronger reception for those times when you’re in the wilderness. The batteries have increased in capacity by 9% and 11% for the 42mm and 46mm watches respectively. The 46mm lasted a good two days in testing with sleep tracking but without exercise. Most people will just about be able to track two days and two nights before needing a charge, which takes 66 minutes using a 20W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting about 70% in 30 minutes. If you do go out for a run, it will last about eight hours of tracking, which is long enough for a marathon or two. Specifications Case size: 42 or 46mm Case thickness: 9.7mm Weight: about 30g or 37g Processor: S10 Storage: 64GB Operating system: watchOS 26 Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, mic, speaker, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeter Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 4, NFC, UWB, optional 5G watchOS 26 The Series 11 ships with watchOS 26, which runs on all models from 2020’s Series 6 and newer. It adds Apple’s new Liquid Glass design, which makes most elements semi-translucent, and adds two new watch faces: a large digital face called Flow that responds to movement and an analogue face called Exactograph, which breaks out hours, minutes and seconds into their own dials. The best new feature is the wrist-flick gesture, where you rapidly twist your wrist away from you and then back to dismiss things and return to the watch face. It works even without raising your wrist to look at the watch, meaning you can dismiss alarms with a satisfying flick of the wrist. Hypertension, sleep and AI workouts The Apple Watch features the same comprehensive health monitoring suite of tools from previous models but adds a couple of new features and a redesigned workout app. Hypertension alerts look for signs of high blood pressure over a 30-day period, notifying you to get yourself checked out if your heart rate data suggests you may have a hidden problem. The new sleep score metric makes Apple’s sleep tracking easier to interpret, similar to competitors from Google, Samsung and others. Each morning the watch shows a score out of 100 that is broken down into three categories: duration, bedtime and interruptions, which are all self-explanatory and viewable in the Health app on the iPhone, too. Workout buddy is an AI coach that uses your previous workout data to give you pep talks before and after workouts, such as recognising that you have already run three times this week and the level of effort you put it. It also provides audible heads-up when you reach certain milestones during exercise, such as a particular pace, heart rate, distance, time or other metrics. There is a choice of three voices, which speak to you over Bluetooth headphones connected to your watch for one of 12 activities, including walking, running or cycling. However, it only works if you also carry your iPhone 15 Pro or later with you, which I found irritating enough that I would forgo the feature to avoid being encumbered with a phone on runs. Sustainability Apple says the battery should last more than 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Repairs cost between £295 and £389 depending on the model. It contains more than 40% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report. Price The Series 11 comes in two sizes (42 and 46mm), a choice of materials and the option of 5G that requires an eSim and compatible phone plan add-on. It starts at £369 (€449/$399/A$679). The 5G models cost an extra £100 (€120/$100/A$170). For comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 costs £749, the Apple Watch SE 3 costs from £219, the Google Pixel Watch 4 costs from £349 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 costs from £294. Verdict The Series 11 hasn’t changed the winning Apple Watch formula but it has added two things that most will appreciate: more scratch-resistant glass and longer battery life. The slim design, fast charging and two-day battery life make the watch easy to live with, particularly for sleep tracking and use as a silent alarm clock. The wrist-flick gesture is so good every watch should have it, while compatibility with straps and charging pucks for all previous Apple Watches is a great bonus for those upgrading. A price cut in the UK is welcome, too. The glass-like design of watchOS 26 may take some getting used to but the software works just the same and introduces some useful features including hypertension alerts, which could be lifesaving. Workout buddy is the most interesting feature. It was a far more positive experience than I was expecting but relies on working out with your phone, too, which is a bit of a drag for runs. Overall, the Series 11 is one of the very best smartwatches available for the iPhone, and if you have an older watch such as a Series 6, you will see a massive upgrade. However, this year its status as the default Apple Watch to buy has been challenged by the revamped Watch SE 3, which offers better value if not quite as many features or as refined a design. Pros: great always-on screen, slim design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, top health tracking, great activity tracking, workout buddy AI trainer, 50-metre water resistance, two-day battery life, optional 5G, long software support, recycled materials, takes older watch straps. Cons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, looks the same as all recent models, undercut by Watch SE.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple"}

That alone will make the iPhone 17 Pro popular for those looking to upgrade and be seen with the newest model. But with the change comes an increase in price to £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999), crossing the £1,000 barrier for the first time for Apple’s smallest Pro phone, which now comes with double the starting storage. From the front it looks like any recent Pro iPhone with the Dynamic Island containing the selfie camera at the top of the super bright and smooth screen. It is one of the best screens on a phone but identical to the regular iPhone 17, which has been upgraded this year. The aluminium sides have been softened with a slight rounding to the edges, giving the phone a nice and comfortable feel in your hand without being too slippery. The phone has gained 5g in weight, which has pushed it over the 200g mark, making it on the heavier side for a smaller handset. A glass panel slightly larger than a credit card is inlaid into the aluminium body and is where MagSafe or Qi2.2 chargers and accessories attach. The large metal “plateau” at the top houses the cameras, which is even bigger than the camera bar on a Pixel. The aluminium will not crack like glass when dropped but it is more scratch-prone, particularly around the edges of the plateau, so a case is still prudent. The handset runs the same iOS 26 as the rest of the iPhone lineup, which introduced Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” interface design. Generally it works well, but it has caused a bit of division over the transparency effects used for buttons and other elements, which blend into the background a little too much sometimes. Specifications Screen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A19 Pro RAM: 12GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iOS 26 Camera: 48MP main, 48MP UW and 48MP 4x zoom, 18MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 150 x 71.9 x 8.75mm Weight: 204g Faster and cooler A19 Pro chip The 17 Pro has a new Apple A19 Pro chip at its heart, which is coupled for the first time in an iPhone with a vapour chamber cooling system. It is a common technique used in many high-performing Android phones and extracts heat from the chip, dispersing it into the rest of the phone’s body to cool it down and keep it running at peak performance for longer. It works well, with the back staying cooler than previous iPhones when playing games for extended sessions while producing better frame rates and being less sweaty to hold. The battery life is solid for a phone of this size, lasting about 42 hours between charges with about six hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi, which is about two hours longer than last year’s model. On heavy-use days out and about or playing lots of games, the 17 Pro still managed to end the day with a good 25% left in the tank. Most people will need to charge the phone every other day for regular use. Sustainability The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. The specialists iFixit awarded the phone a seven out of 10 for repairability. It contains more than 30% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera There are three 48-megapixel cameras on the back and a new 18MP selfie camera with a few new tricks on the front. The main and ultra-wide cameras are very similar to last year, shoot some great photos across a range of lighting conditions and are particularly good for street photography with solid detail. The main camera offers a 2x crop zoom, which is great, appearing similar in detail and colour to 1x shots in good light, although a little more grainy in dimmer lighting. New for this year is an upgraded telephoto camera that is now 4x at 48MP, up from 5x at 12MP, which produces very good, well-balanced photos that are full of detail. It can manage an 8x crop zoom similar to the main camera, which is equally good in bright light with only a slight degradation of detail. Both zoom levels do pretty well in dimmer indoor light, too. All three cameras shoot some of the best video on a phone and have many other features, including an excellent macrophotography mode and the ability to shoot video from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, placing the operator into a little window. Apple’s automatic portrait mode is solid and works with objects, not only people and pets. Finally, the selfie camera has had its first upgrade on an iPhone in many years, beefed up to an 18MP sensor with Apple’s Centre Stage tech from its iPads and Macs. It has the ability to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame for video calls but it can also expand the frame to shoot landscape selfies when holding the phone in portrait orientation. It’s a novel solution to the problem of trying to fit everyone in for group selfies without having to turn the phone. Price The iPhone 17 Pro costs from £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone 17 costs £799, iPhone Air costs £999, iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 Pro costs £999, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,099 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499. Verdict The 17 Pro is the first different-looking iPhone in years, which instantly makes it stand out despite not being functionally all that different from recent models. The new aluminium unibody design feels nice, although it will scratch more easily than glass. The screen and performance are top-notch, while the battery life is solid for a fairly compact handset. It is a really nice iPhone and one of the very best phones that isn’t ginormous. But this year it competes with the super-thin iPhone Air, which steals some of the limelight, and an upgraded standard iPhone 17, which is cheaper but matches the Pro on screen quality for the first time, although it lacks a zoom camera. That leaves the camera as the big differentiator. The 17 Pro has top-notch cameras including a new and improved telephoto camera, which is one of the best in the business. So for an iPhone buyer who wants a telephoto camera to zoom in on your subjects, the 17 Pro is the model to get. You just have to pay a pretty penny for it. Pros: looks different to other models, relatively compact, great cameras including 4x/8x telephoto, upgraded selfie camera, great screen, USB-C, good battery life, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: expensive, heavier than previous models, lack of cutting-edge AI features compared with rivals, same screen and size can be found on cheaper model.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple"}

Indeed Butterfield, the owner of Sandford Orchards, near Exeter, is buying extra tanks to increase cider production after the UK’s hottest summer on record resulted in an abundance of fruit. “I think God’s a cider maker,” he joked. To thrive, fruit trees need heat and light and this year “we had lots of both”. “I’ve had boughs breaking on trees under the weight of fruit,” Butterfield continued. “It’s probably going to be the best vintage since 2018.” With more than 20 years in the business, he declared: “It might even be the best in my cider-making lifetime. We’re looking at an incredibly special year.” The National Association of Cider Makers (NACM) says the warm spring and summer have produced apples “full of rich flavours and natural sweetness”, despite the fact that the reduced rainfall means the fruit is slightly smaller than average. “I’ve heard from cider makers and growers that the sugar and tannin levels are very high, which means the quality of the fruit will be outstanding,” said the NACM chair, David Sheppy, who is also the managing director of Sheppy’s Cider. “It is going to be a good year for quality.” The record-breaking summer temperatures this year that contributed to the abundance of apples was made about 70 times more likely because of human-induced climate change, the Met Office concluded in an analysis published earlier this month. The mean temperature across June, July and August was 16.1C (70F), significantly above the current record of 15.8C set in 2018, with the country also seeing four heatwaves across a single season. Sheppy, whose family has 36 hectares (90 acres) of orchards in Somerset, said the trees had “suffered a little bit”. Mature trees “don’t mind a dry spell”, he said, but the stress of the dry weather meant he had observed a small number that had split and lost their branches. Cider-producers have moved to make the most of this year’s bumper crop. Sandford Orchards, which makes Devon Red cider, has installed eight new 50,000-litre (11,000-gallon) tanks and Butterfield is particularly excited to have lots of Tremlett’s Bitter apples, meaning Sandford Orchards can bottle a single variety for the first time in seven years. He describes their “leathery and marmaladey” notes and “rich natural sweetness”. There is also good news for perry drinkers after last year’s disaster. Albert Johnson, director of Ross-on-Wye Cider &amp; Perry Company bills it as a “bounceback year”. “Last year was so bad for perry pears, probably over half the crop was wiped out by the bad conditions in the growing season,” he said. It is a different story this year. “If anything, the pear sugars are up even more than the apples, and there’s plenty of them. So it’s a really exciting year for perry.” Industry figures show that while UK cider sales edged up slightly to £3.1bn in 2024, the overall amount drunk declined by about 3% to 676m litres. Sheppy, the sixth generation of his family to work in cider-making, said the industry “had been in decline, but it’s picking up again”. “It’s coming back,” he said of the sector, which supports about 65,000 jobs. “There’s a lot of innovation and new ideas, both around reducing alcohol content but also at the higher end … to appeal to the modern drinker. “Like a lot of industries, cider goes through phases. But there’s a strong passion for the industry in this country. It’s a close connection with the land and farmers.” Sheppy’s harvest started at the end of last week. “We grow 40 different varieties of apples,” he said. “The earliest ones are ripening now but the main cider apple varieties, like Dabinett, Harry Masters and Yarlington Mill, are ready mid- to late October, early November. That’s the key time.” But even if this year is one to remember, Sheppy is keen to point out that the industry doesn’t have “bad years”, only “bad harvests”. “It’s not like when you get a wetter harvest, the quality is not as good, because that’s all in the blending process. We can blend a good year with a bad year and maintain the quality, that is part of the art of being a cider maker.”", "section": "Business", "query": "Apple"}

Beyond the obvious engineering effort that has gone into creating one of the slimmest phones ever made, the Air is a reductive exercise that boils down the iPhone into the absolute essentials in a premium body. Cut away the rear cameras, slim down the battery, remove the stereo speakers and maximise the screen, and what is left is an impressive sliver of titanium and glass. Doing so isn’t cheap. The iPhone Air starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799), sitting in between the standard £799 iPhone 17 and the £1,099 17 Pro models. Photos don’t do the Air justice. You know it is something special as soon as you pick it up. Its 5.64mm-thick frame feels thinner thanks to soft edges and light weight that’s 12g less than the already quite light iPhone 17. The glass lump on the back contains most of the guts of the phone with the rest dedicated to the battery. The usual iPhone buttons line the sides including the camera control and action buttons. The earpiece speaker in the top is the only one: it is pretty good but you can tell there’s no stereo sound when watching videos, which is a bit of a shame as the 6.5in screen is smooth, bright and fantastic. The Air behaves just like any other modern iPhone. It runs iOS 26 with its glass-like design, has all the same apps, Face ID and is super responsive. There is only one hiccup and that’s the lack of a nano sim card tray, as the iPhone Air relies entirely on eSim. In the US Apple has only supported eSims since the iPhone 14, but models sold everywhere else had nano sim slots, until the Air. Most of the major networks in the UK can provide eSims, but the experience of setting it up or moving between phones isn’t great for all of them and not all budget providers support them. The mobile networks have some work to do to make eSims a good experience everywhere. Specifications Screen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU) RAM: 12GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iOS 26 Camera: 48MP rear; 18MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G eSim-only, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 156.2 x 74.7 x 5.64mm Weight: 165g A19 Pro chip The Air has the A19 Pro chip similar to the iPhone 17 Pro, but with one fewer GPU core, reducing its performance a little for games and other graphics-intensive tasks. It feels rapid in daily tasks but gets noticeably warmer by the camera lump when doing intensive jobs. Despite most of the body being dedicated to the battery, a smaller capacity cell is the Air’s first big concession to slenderness. The battery life is shorter than other iPhones, but isn’t as bad as you might imagine. For relatively light days with the screen actively used for five hours for browsing, messaging and watching video mostly on wifi, the Air lasted a decent 40 hours between charges. On heavier days, shooting photos, using mapping on 5G out and about, listening to music, messaging and watching video on the commute, the Air lasted about 30 hours, ending the day with roughly 25% left. It should see out most days with a nightly charge, but if you do lots of gaming or other more intensive tasks you may need low power mode. Sustainability The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. Specialists iFixit awarded the iPhone Air a seven out of 10 for repairability. It contains more than 35% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The camera is the second big concession. The Air only has a single 48-megapixel camera on the back with the new and improved 18MP selfie camera with Centre Stage tech from the iPhone 17 line on the front. The main camera matches that from the regular iPhone 17, not the larger sensor from the 17 Pro, but performs admirably. It can shoot great photos and video in good lighting and manages dim indoor light fairly well. It can look a bit soft and grainy at times and won’t win any camera awards, but generally shoots decent photos. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which is pretty good in brighter scenes, but zoom further and your photos have all the hallmarks of digital zoom: surfaces and people look a bit soft and detail is lost in more distant subjects. The lack of an ultrawide and telephoto camera certainly hampers the shots you can get. The only other iPhone with a single rear camera is the lower cost iPhone 16e. The 18MP front-facing camera automatically pans and zooms to fit everyone in group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies without having to turn the phone sideways, which is a neat trick. You can also shoot video from the front and rear cameras at the same time to put the photographer in the frame in a little window. Price The iPhone Air costs from £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone 17 is £799, iPhone 17 Pro is £1,099, the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 costs £799, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is £899 and the Fairphone 6 sells for £499. Verdict The iPhone Air is a remarkable design seeking a problem to solve. I’m not sure many people have looked at their current smartphone and wished it would be thinner rather than having longer battery life and a better camera. The super-slender frame feels transformative when you first pick it up, but the novelty quickly wears off. As with Samsung’s equally thin Galaxy S25 Edge, the lighter weight is the most meaningful change making it easier to hold and pocket. The Air has a big screen but won’t weigh you down. The battery life is better than expected and should see out most days with some left in the tank when new, which may not be the case after a couple of years of use. Apple sells a smart MagSafe battery to add another 65% capacity to the Air, but slapping it on the back removes the benefit of the thin and light design. So does adding a case. The biggest concession is the single camera on the back. The lack of ultrawide and telephoto options is a cut too far for me using a phone as my primary method for capturing memories. But if you are an Apple buyer who wants a slender novelty that is great to hold and use, the iPhone Air is a special piece of hardware. For everyone else there are better options elsewhere. Pros: super thin and lightweight, great screen, good single rear camera, upgraded Centre Stage selfie camera, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no ultrawide or telephoto cameras, expensive, relatively short battery life, deserves to be used without a case, lack of cutting-edge AI.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple"}

It’s an apocryphal demonstration of how behaviours and beliefs can be adopted and perpetuated, long after the OG reasons for them fade. I’m pretty sure they could’ve just used humans and brussels sprouts as a metaphor instead. Like most veg of medieval origin, brassicas, of which sprouts are a baby-cabbage-y-version, were grown for hardiness and weather-resistance. As a result, the flavour skewed bitter, and the texture, tough and oftentimes woody. To help break this down, cooks would boil the bejesus out of them, inadvertently tripping the sulfuric (read: farty) compounds activated during digestion. So unholy was the stench that the superstitious cooks cut crosses into the bases of each sprout to ward off any evil spirits hiding between the leaves. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning While our beliefs around haunted sprouts might’ve changed, we’re still cross-hatching them for no reason, we’re still overboiling and underseasoning them, and as a result the way your grandparents felt about brussels sprouts is probably the way your kids still do. These are all behaviours that can and should be actively unlearned, lest we miss out on the bananas up the ladder, so to speak. Brussels sprouts have had a glow-up, and they’re ready for a second chance. For one thing, they don’t taste the same as Nan and Pop’s because they’re not the same. About 30 years ago, a Dutch scientist named Hans van Doorn (that’s DooRn not DooM) discovered that the flavonoids (flavour compounds) sinigrin and progoitrin were responsible for the bitterness in brussels sprouts, and are also found in mustard seeds and horseradish. Through a concentrated breeding program, Van Doorn was able to prioritise higher-yield, sweeter sprouts that were lower in these compounds. For another thing, we’ve got a better understanding of how sprouts like to be touched for maximum pleasure. The key is to work fast, either crisping the sprouts in a hot oven or air fryer, or leaving the sprouts raw and “cooking” them with acid instead of heat. I love burning halved, oiled sprouts in a searing-hot oven for 10-12 minutes, or shredding and rubbing with lemon juice and salt flakes as the base of a slaw. Another way to indemnify yourself against overcooking a sprout is to par-cook and then finish them in the pan, as I do below. If better technique is not enough to get you or your household’s eaters over the line, I still have a magic bullet or three up my sleeve. Thanks to science writers such as Harold McGee, we now have a clearer understanding of how other ingredients can mitigate bitterness; chiefly, salty things, fatty things and sweet things. Salt helps to smooth out bitterness and render a “creamier” experience of a bitter vegetable; the fats in oil, butter or schmaltzy/porky things offer a rich foil where the bitterness creates a lovely interplay, and adding sweetness offers even more dimension. I’m deploying all three in the below, which you can serve as a side. It can also stand alone, bulked up with black beluga lentils or green lentils. Kaiserfleisch is German-style smoked pork belly, with a thicker, more decadent cut and structure, earning its title “royal meat” or “emperor’s meat”. If you can’t find kaiserfleisch, any thick-cut bacon or pancetta will hit the spot here. You could even ask your butcher to lop you off a 1cm-thick slice of leg ham. You could also choose to skip the pork entirely and go for some fried shiitake mushrooms instead. Just wet fry them and add some extra oil to the pan for extra schmaltziness. I’ve used a combo of green and purple sprouts for extra visual appeal. Sometimes the novelty factor can help to increase willingness to try a new veg, handy when cooking for kids for example. There isn’t too much difference between the two – the purples just have anthocyanin (purple pigment) isolated, captured and bred into the varieties, as you might find in purple cabbage, which can deepen the colour and flavour slightly. Buttery brussels sprouts with kaiserfleisch and apple – recipe Serves 4-6 as a side 200g kaiserfleisch, cubed (or 1cm-thick piece of ham, or thick-cut bacon or pancetta) 600g brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered 1 tangy apple (I use pink lady but granny smith would also work) 5-6 dried juniper berries, crushed 50g butter Salt and freshly cracked pepper Pop kaiserfleisch into a cold pan with a splash of water and fry on medium-high heat to help render out the fat and colour the cut sides. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to the boil, then drop in the quartered sprouts for two to three minutes (you’ll know they’re ready when they’re vibrantly green). While you wait, cut the apple into 1cm cubes (skin on) and crush the juniper berries in a mortar and pestle or with the base of an olive oil bottle, then drop them both into the pan with the kaiserfleisch and crank the heat. Sizzling is good! Scoop the boiled sprouts from the pot, give the sieve/strainer a good tap to shake off excess moisture, then dump them into the pan with the kaiserfleisch and apples, drop in the butter and swish about to melt. Keep the pan sizzling for the sprouts to absorb the flavours, then switch off and taste for seasoning, adding salt and freshly cracked pepper as needed. Serve with sausages and mustard. To take it from side to main, add a tin of lentils – rinsed and drained – before you add the butter and swish them about to warm through in the pan, then switch off the heat and serve with crusty bread.", "section": "Life and style", "query": "Apple"}

The new iPad Air M3 costs from £599 (€699/$599/A$999) – the same as its predecessor – and comes in two sizes with either an 11in or 13in screen. It sits between the base-model £329 iPad A16 and the £999 iPad Pro M4, splitting the difference in price and features. Nothing has changed on the outside of the tablet. The M3 model is a straight replacement for the M2 model, featuring the same crisp screen, sleek aluminium design and Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button. The Centre Stage webcam at the top of the screen makes video calls a breeze by automatically panning and scanning to keep you and your family in frame. Stereo speakers make watching TV and films great, while support for the £129 Apple Pencil Pro makes doodling or taking notes a joy. Specifications Screen: 11in or 13in Liquid Retina display (264ppi) Processor: Apple M3 (9-core GPU) RAM: 8GB Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iPadOS 18.4 Camera: 12MP rear, 12MP centre stage Connectivity: Wifi 6E (5G optional eSim-only), Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Touch ID, Smart Connecter Dimensions: 247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm or 280.6 x 214.9 x 6.1mm Weight: 460g or 616g M3 upgrade and solid battery life The big change for the new Air is an upgrade to the Apple M3 chip, which was first seen in late 2023 in the MacBook Pro and was successfully used in the MacBook Air until March when it was replaced with the M4 chip. While the M3 isn’t Apple’s latest chip, it is still far more powerful than most will ever need in a tablet and much faster than the competition. It is about 10-20% quicker than the outgoing M2 model in tests and will make short work of games and even pro-level apps such as Affinity Photo, Procreate or Adobe Lightroom. Combined with a reliable battery life of nine to 10 hours, it can easily be used as a laptop replacement when equipped with accessories such as the new version of Apple’s excellent Magic Keyboard case, although that comes at great cost at £269. Cheaper third-party options from Logitech and others are available, however. The iPad Air runs iPadOS 18.4, which includes a collection of multitasking tools, and can be plugged into an external monitor such as a laptop via the USB-C port. But the M3 chip also enables various Apple Intelligence features, which are not available on the standard iPad A16. These include several AI image editing and generation tools, writing and proofreading tools, ChatGPT integration into Siri and other bits. Sustainability Apple says the battery should last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity, and can be replaced from £115. The tablet is generally repairable, with a damaged out-of-warranty repair costing from £429. The tablet contains at least 30% recycled content, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. Apple breaks down the tablet’s environmental impact in its report and offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The 11in iPad Air M3 costs from £599 (€699/$599/A$999) and the 13in iPad Air M3 costs from £799 (€949/$799/A$1,349). For comparison, the iPad A16 costs from £329, the iPad Pro M4 costs from £999 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE costs from £499. The MacBook Air M4 starts at £999. Verdict The iPad Air M3 is a great premium tablet that makes for an excellent upgrade over the base model Apple tablet. It is a highly capable machine with laptop-level power, long battery life, a quality screen and plenty of accessories to turn it into a drawing tablet, computer replacement or many other tools. The choice of sizes balances nicely between portability at the 11in and the big-screen utility of the 13in version. But the M3 model isn’t an upgrade worth making over recent iPad Air versions, and if all you do is watch TV or films on it, the standard iPad A16 does the job for much less. Meanwhile, the top-end iPad Pro M4 beats the Air on all counts but costs an awful lot more. So for those looking for a premium do-it-all tablet, the iPad Air M3 is hard to beat.

A golden pastry base, which cleverly doubles as the crumble topping, holds the tender apple and rhubarb fruit filling, and a thin meringue layer strikes just the right balance of buttery, sweet, and tangy. Meanwhile, a pudding that creates its own sauce while baking always feels magical. The secret lies in the different densities of the batter and the liquid poured over it just before baking – during its time in the oven, the two layers separate into a cake with a rich, molten sauce beneath. It’s a clever (and delicious) trick. Apple and rhubarb crumb bars The apple filling should be made in advance (up to two days), giving it plenty of time to cool before being spooned over the base. Serve these bars on their own with tea, or warm with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream for a sweet finish to a feast. Prep 15 min Macerate 30 min+ Cook 2 hr 10 min, plus cooling Serves 8-12 For the apple filling 1½kg apples (4 large granny smiths and 4 large pink ladys), peeled, cored and cut into ½cm-thick pieces (1kg net) 80g caster sugar 2 tbsp lemon juice 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar 1 tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground nutmeg ⅛ tsp fine sea salt 2 tbsp unsalted butter 2½ tsp cornflour 200g rhubarb, cut into 1cm pieces, or whole blackberries Icing sugar, for dusting For the pastry 400g plain flour 150g caster sugar, plus 70g for the meringue Finely grated zest of 1 lemon 1 tsp baking powder ¼ tsp fine sea salt 180g unsalted butter, cold and cut into 6-8 pieces, plus 10g, softened, for greasing 4 eggs; 1 whole, 3 separated 1 tsp vanilla extract Put the apples, sugar, lemon juice, vinegar, spices and salt into a large bowl and toss to combine. Set aside to macerate at room temperature, tossing occasionally, for at least 30 minutes (and up to two hours). Strain the apples, reserving the juice in a jug – you should have about 100ml (top up with water if you’re short). Put a large saute pan over a medium heat and add one tablespoon of butter and half the strained apples. Cook, tossing regularly, for about 10 minutes, until the apples begin to soften. Tip them into a bowl and repeat with the remaining butter and raw apples. When the second batch of apples has softened, return the first batch to the pan. Whisk the cornflour into the reserved strained juice then stir into the pan. Cook for a minute until the juices thicken, then scrape the apples into a bowl. Stir in the rhubarb/blackberries and leave to cool completely. For the pastry, put the flour, 150g sugar, lemon zest, baking powder and salt in a food processor and pulse to combine and aerate. Add 180g butter and pulse again until it’s barely visible. Whisk the whole egg, yolks and vanilla together, then stream into the food processor, pulsing until the pastry starts to come together. Tip out on to a clean bench and knead gently to bring it together. Roll into a fat log, then slice it into two pieces, one weighing about 500g and the other 300g. Put the smaller log into the fridge. Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½ and grease a deep baking tray of about 33cm x 23cm x 4cm with the extra 10g softened butter. Slice the larger pastry log into 1cm-thick discs and lay in one layer on the base of the baking tray. Press the pastry together to form an even layer, then spoon the cooled fruit filling on top. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the whisk attachment on medium-high until soft peaks form. Drizzle in 70g caster sugar and continue whisking until firm peaks form. Spoon the mixture on top of the apple layer, and level with a small spatula. Remove the smaller pastry log from the fridge and crumble it evenly the meringue layer (you could also grate it on the large holes of a box grater). Bake for one hour, covering loosely with foil if the pastry gets too dark. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes, before slicing into large squares. Dust liberally with icing sugar and serve with cream or ice-cream. Spiced chocolate and hazelnut pudding with amaretto whipped cream Here, I’ve infused the pudding with the warm spices of hot cross buns and paired it with an alcohol-spiked cream for an indulgent finish to an Easter feast. The ingredients list looks long, I know, but rest assured it is simple to make. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 6 60g unsalted butter, plus 10g extra, softened, for greasing 120g self-raising flour ¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda 15g cocoa powder 1 tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground ginger ¼ tsp ground nutmeg ⅛ tsp ground allspice ⅛ tsp ground cloves ¼ tsp fine sea salt 60g finely ground blanched hazelnuts 100g dark chocolate (70%), roughly chopped 70g caster sugar Finely grated zest of 1 orange 120ml milk 1 tsp vanilla extract For the topping 80g light brown sugar 10g cocoa powder, plus extra for dusting A pinch of fine sea salt 300ml very hot water from a recently boiled kettle For the serving cream 300ml double cream 1 tbsp icing sugar 1 tbsp Amaretto or dark rum (optional) Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½ and grease the base and sides of a deep ovenproof dish (about 22cm in diameter) with the 10g softened butter. Sift the flour, bicarb, cocoa powder, spices and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the ground hazelnuts, stir well to combine, then set aside. Put the chocolate and butter in a small bowl and put over a small pan of barely simmering water, making sure that the base of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir occasionally until melted, then remove from the heat. Add the sugar and orange zest, whisk gently to combine, then add the milk and vanilla extract. Whisk again to incorporate, then pour the mix into the dry ingredients. Stir until fully combined (it will be quite thick), then scrape the batter into the buttered dish and level the surface with a small spatula. For the topping, put the brown sugar, cocoa powder and salt into a small bowl and whisk to combine. Scatter this mixture evenly on top of the pudding to cover in a thick layer, then carefully spoon the hot water all over the top. Bake for about 35 minutes, until the pudding forms a slightly crusty, shiny top and the centre springs back when tapped lightly. Meanwhile, put all the ingredients for the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the whisk attachment on medium speed until soft waves form. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Remove the pudding from the oven and while the sauce is still molten, sieve a little cocoa powder on top, then bring to the table. Scoop large spoonfuls into serving bowls and serve with the whipped cream on the side.

The company’s thinnest and lightest laptop currently starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,699) – £100 less than last year’s model – and has Apple’s top M4 chip with a minimum of 16GB of memory, making the cheapest model much more capable. Nothing has changed since 2022 on the outside other than a fetching new light blue colour that replaces the longstanding “space grey”. The aluminium body is just as well made, thin and light. The keyboard is excellent, the Touch ID fingerprint reader in the power button is fast and the generous trackpad is best in class. The 13.6in LCD screen is crisp and good, although limited to 60Hz, unlike the faster and smoother screen on the MacBook Pro line and some rivals. New for this year is an upgraded webcam, which is now 12 megapixels and sports Apple’s Centre Stage tech for automatic panning and scanning, plus support for Desk View for demonstrating things remotely, similar to the M4 MacBook Pro. Two meaningful changes have been made on the inside. The new M4 chip makes the Air essentially as fast as the MacBook Pro, which is to say very fast and snappy indeed. In tests it is only marginally slower than the Pro despite not having a fan to keep it cool for prolonged periods, and faster than the iPad Pro with M4 chip. There is little the Air will not be able to manage outside workstation-class workloads. Note the cheapest model has two fewer graphics cores on its chip, which will make it slightly less powerful for certain apps and games. All Airs now also come with at least 16GB of memory, which is the recommended minimum amount for modern laptops. The previous model started with only 8GB of memory, which cost £200 to double. Along with powerful chips, the Air’s main selling point – very long battery life – remains. For general light workloads using browsers, notes apps, word processing, image editing, chats and emails, the Air regularly lasts more than 16 hours between charges, which is roughly two full work days on battery. Pushed a bit harder, such as developing and editing photos, the Air still managed more than 10 hours’ work on battery. Specifications Screen: 13.6in LCD (2560x1600; 224 ppi) True Tone Processor: Apple M4 with eight or 10-core GPU RAM: 16, 24 or 32GB Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB SSD Operating system: macOS 15 Sequoia Camera: 12MP Centre Stage Connectivity: wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 2x Thunderbolt/USB 4, headphones Dimensions: 215 x 304.1 x 11.3mm Weight: 1.24kg Sustainability The MacBook Air is made with 55% recycled materials including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare-earth elements, steel and tin. Apple breaks down the computer’s environmental impact in its report. The computer is generally repairable, and the battery can be replaced for £159 by Apple. The repair specialists iFixit gave the machine five out of 10 for repairability. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. macOS Sequoia 15.4 The Air runs the same macOS Sequoia software as the rest of the Mac lineup, recently updated to version 15.4, which brings with it a few more Apple Intelligence features. The Mac Mail app has been redesigned to more closely resemble the app on an iPhone with AI email categorisation, such as promotional emails, receipts and others. AI notification summaries are useful, as is iPhone mirroring if you also use an Apple smartphone. The new snapping and window tiling tools are very handy, allowing you to quickly arrange your windows with either mouse or keyboard shortcuts, something that previously required third-party tools. Price The Apple 13in MacBook Air starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,699) with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. 15in versions start at £1,199 (€1,499/$1,199/A$2,099). For comparison, the M4 MacBook Pro starts at £1,599, the Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Edge costs £1,399 and the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 starts at £1,049. Verdict The MacBook Air is the consumer laptop to beat unless you specifically need Windows. It simply offers a better combination of performance, battery life, speakers, keyboard and trackpad than rivals. The M4 chip upgrade keeps it ahead of the pack while being fanless and therefore silent at all times. The new Centre Stage webcam is a huge improvement, too, for anyone who lives on video calls for work. The screen is still great, although this is one area where better displays can be found on competitors at higher cost. It only has two USB-C ports but at least it can be charged via the MagSafe port to keep them available for connections. A price cut to about £1,000 or equivalent for the 13in model is very welcome, as is the minimum of 16GB of memory, which makes the 2025 MacBook Air surprisingly good value for a premium notebook. Pros: super-fast M4 chip, silent and cool running, extremely long battery life, good 13.6in screen, great keyboard, best-in-class trackpad, MagSafe, good speakers, Centre Stage webcam, Touch ID. Cons: only two USB-C ports and no USB-A or SD card slot, no Face ID, RAM and SSD upgrades are expensive and cannot be changed after purchase, no wifi 7.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple"}

Titi monkeys swing in the treetops as the Mocoa River roars nearby. For four years, he and his family have lived quietly in this biodiverse “gateway to the Amazon”, where the Andes descend into the rainforest, home to mountain tapirs, spectacled bears and vital rivers. But Portillo, 46, fears this peaceful landscape is at risk. Canadian company Copper Giant Resources has been exploring nearby mountains with a view to opening one of Colombia’s largest copper mines. Beneath Mocoa lie an estimated 2m tonnes of copper, a transition metal vital for clean energy in wind turbines and batteries. Copper Giant holds four permits for the exploration and possible development of copper and molybdenum, and has expanded its land in Mocoa to more than 136,000 hectares (337,000 acres) by acquiring Grupo Minera Sol in June, a Colombian company that holds 12 mining applications covering 53,474 hectares (132,000 acres). “We’re surrounded by nature and the air you breathe is pure,” says Portillo. “What we fear is that all of this would be destroyed, completely finished.” As the world strives toward a carbon-free future, demand for copper has soared. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) thinktank, copper prices reached a high of $10,800 (£8,000) a tonne last year, while demand is projected to grow by 30% by 2040. Supplies have not kept pace, with the IEA predicting a 30% shortfall by 2035, and Colombia’s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro, has prioritised securing minerals crucial to the energy transition, including copper. But critics say the push to extract copper in Mocoa risks undermining another of Petro’s promises: preserving the Amazon. Mocoa sits along the Cauca metallogenic belt, a stretch of the Andes known to be rich with minerals, and at the edge of the Amazon rainforest. Efforts to develop a mine in the area have long faced resistance from local people, who believe that such a project would cause irreversible damage to the fragile ecosystems and pollute the waters on which they rely. In March, residents of Pueblo Viejo, near the exploration area, protested over a road to the site. What started as demands for Copper Giant to fix the road turned into a 47-day blockade, demanding that the government stop mining. Since then, residents have established a “resistance camp” and barred company vehicles during working hours. Signs reading “water is more valuable than copper” and “land, water and life are non-negotiable” are on display. “We’re speaking out because we want people to realise we can protect mountains and countryside before it’s too late,” Portillo says. In May, CorpoAmazonia, the regional environmental authority, and the environment ministry reached a deal with protesters to review the viability of the mining project. By early June, the authority issued a resolution designating 93,000 hectares (230,000 acres), including land within the mining concessions, as an “area of ecological importance”, where mining activities would be restricted. Although the resolution is non-binding, it has increased pressure on the national government. “What we want to avoid is the displacement and extinction of flora and fauna species and also to avoid the contamination of water sources,” says a CorpoAmazonia official, speaking anonymously as they were not authorised to comment publicly. The official says the report notes the mining concession overlaps with the protective forest reserve of the upper Mocoa River basin, a conservation area that is home to more than 350 species of flora and fauna and serves as a critical water source for local communities. He also warned that the use of explosives and heavy metals in copper extraction endangers the integrity of the protected area and other fragile ecosystems, such as the water-generating páramos (tropical Andean wetland grassland ecosystems), that are located within the mining concessions. *** Copper Giant says the project in Colombia is still in the early stages of exploration, a phase that could last another eight to 10 years, and that it is too early to determine the environmental impacts of copper mining in the area. “We don’t even have a design for the mine yet,” says Thyana Álvarez, Copper Giant country manager. Álvarez adds that last year, the company requested that Colombia’s National Mining Agency excluded the forest reserve areas from its mining concessions. “We are awaiting the new concession contracts with these removals,” she says. Still, the dispute in Mocoa has highlighted tensions within Petro’s environmental agenda. In 2023, the president announced a shift away from oil and gas exploration and ordered the exploration of energy transition materials. That same year, his administration classified 17 minerals, copper among them, as “strategic” for their role in the country’s energy transition. “I have asked the energy minister to focus mining exploration on fundamental raw materials so that Colombia can become an enormous generator of clean energy,” Petro said in 2023. But critics have said the rush to extract minerals critical to the energy transition could come at the cost of the Amazon rainforest, considered a vital carbon sink essential for the fight against the climate emergency. About 40% of Colombia’s territory is part of the Amazon region. José Luis López, a researcher at the National University’s Observatory of Environmental Conflict in Bogotá, says Colombia’s climate crisis strategy would be more effective if it focused on “conserving biodiversity and halting forest degradation” rather than expanding mining. In May, the environment minister, Lena Estrada, publicly addressed the protests in Mocoa, noting that the ministry is reviewing local calls for stricter protection. “They’re asking for environmental zoning of those territories,” she said. “We’re going to review this possibility. We’re going to make the province of Putumayo [where Mocoa is located], like all the other Amazonian provinces, protected areas.” The national mining agency did not respond to a request for comment. In Pueblo Viejo, Portillo and others remain suspicious and continue to voice their opposition. They hold resistance camp meetings and have launched a campaign to create awareness among the surrounding communities about the impact a mine could have. Portillo says that he will continue until Copper Giant leaves their territory. “We refuse,” he says, “to be sacrificed for the energy transition.”", "section": "Global development", "query": "Amazon"}

About 540 square miles of land have been cleared for mining in the South American country since 1984, and the environmental destruction is spreading rapidly across the country, Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) and its Peruvian partner organisation, Conservación Amazónica, found. The gold rush is also poisoning its waterways. Illegal miners use dredges – floating machines that chew up and spit out riverbeds – leaving the toxic mercury used to extract gold from sediment in their wake. Ultra-high resolution aerial images allowed MAAP, part of Amazon Conservation, to identify dredges alongside deforestation for the first time, enabling them to identify goldminers and revealing that the environmental crisis once confined to the south of the country was creeping north. “We used to only see it in the Madre de Dios region but now we’re seeing it everywhere”, said MAAP’s director, Matt Finer. The price of gold topped $4,000 for the first time this week on the international markets as global anxiety increased about financial fragility. Indigenous groups have sounded the alarm that as the price of soars, armed groups were increasingly tearing down their forests and poisoning their rivers in pursuit of the precious metal. MAAP’s aerial images show that once dense swathes of green jungle are being transformed into lifeless moonscapes of grey earth pocked with stagnant pools of green water. “This little square is just a tiny sample,” Finer says, pointing to a small section of the vast red patchwork of deforestation mapped in the report. “Imagine this multiplied to 140,000 hectares.” The mercury residues build up in fish and pass to the people who eat them, leading to neurological and developmental problems such as birth defects and learning difficulties. A recent study of riverside communities in Peru’s northernmost region of Loreto found the median level of mercury was nearly four times the World Health Organization’s recommended limit. MAAP’s analysis found that 225 rivers and streams have been affected, with 989 dredges spotted in Loreto since 2017 – including 275 this year alone on the Nanay River, a tributary of the Amazon that is the lifeblood of ecosystems and dozens of Indigenous communities. “They are poisoning our rivers – it’s the water that we drink,” said Roberto Tafur Shupingahua, a representative of several riverside communities in Loreto. Shupingahua said local communities began blocking miners from advancing up the River Tigre in Loreto 40 days ago, leading to gunfights with armed intruders. “We have no choice but to fight back but we are alone. The state is nowhere to be seen,” he said, his voice raising in anger. Mining remains concentrated in the Madre de Dios region in southern Peru but new hotspots are emerging farther north in Loreto, Amazonas, Huánuco, Pasco and Ucayali. They are small but once mining is established it could expand quickly, Finer said, adding that the report was a glimpse into what was happening across the rest of the Amazon. “This is the first time we’ve been able to look in this detail at a country but I think in Brazil, Bolivia and Colombia we are going to see exactly the same thing,” he said. MAAP’s report showed more dredges appearing on Peru’s jungle frontiers with Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. With gold prices surpassing $4,000 an ounce, foreign, armed groups are increasingly venturing across the border into Peru’s lawless jungles where local authorities are doing little to stop them, says Bram Ebus, a criminologist and consultant for the International Crisis Group. Criminal networks, including the Comandos de la Frontera from Colombia and Comando Vermelho from Brazil, are increasingly active across the border. “International crime networks trafficking cocaine and laundering profits through illegal gold mining – now with peak prices providing hefty returns – are combined with a government in Lima that has not been a serious obstacle against organised crime,” Ebus said. The Andean Group – a political coalition of South American countries – told Peru on Tuesday to get serious about illegal mining or it could face economic sanctions. But Finer said: “Gold is just so profitable right now. I don’t see any signs of prices going down, so it’s probably going to get worse before it gets better.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon"}

Coming less than three months before Brazil hosts the Cop30 climate summit in Belém, the news has shocked conservation groups, who say it is now more important than ever that consumers, supermarkets and traders stand up against Brazilian agribusiness groups that are using their growing political power to reverse past environmental gains. Brazil is the world’s biggest soya bean exporter. The legume, used largely for animal and fish feed, is one of the most widely grown crops in Brazil, and posed a huge deforestation threat to the Amazon rainforest until stakeholders voluntarily agreed to impose a moratorium and no longer source it from the region in 2006. The voluntary agreement brought together farmers, environmentalists and international food companies such as Cargill and McDonald’s, and determined that any detection of soya beans planted on areas deforested after 2008 would result in the farm being blocked from supply chains, regardless of whether the land clearance was legal in Brazil. In the 19 years since, the moratorium has been hailed as a conservation success story that has improved the reputation of global brands, enabled soy production to expand significantly without Amazon destruction and prevented an estimated 17,000 sq km of deforestation. But earlier this week it was revealed that the anti-monopoly agency, Cade (the administrative council for economic defence) had given grain traders, such as Bunge, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus and Cofco, 10 days to suspend the moratorium or face financial penalties. Cade’s general superintendent, Alexandre Barreto de Souza, said he had instigated an investigation into the moratorium, noting that it involved sharing commercially sensitive information. Greenpeace Brazil called the move a “terrible mistake”, which was the result of political pressure from the “regressive wings of agribusiness” that aimed to punish those who protect forests and reward those who profit the most from Amazon destruction. “Without the soy moratorium, considered one of the most effective multi-stakeholder agreements in the world, soy will once again become a major driver of Amazon deforestation, and this will bury any chance of Brazil meeting its climate targets,” Cristiane Mazzetti, the group’s forest campaign coordinator, said. Politically, the timing could not be more embarrassing for the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In November, Brazil will stage the first climate conference to be held in the Amazon, which the hosts had hoped would be a showcase for the gains it has made in reducing deforestation. But in the Brazilian congress, the dominant agribusiness lobby has passed legislation that undermines indigenous land demarcation and the environmental licensing system, a step that conservation groups have described as the biggest setback in 40 years. The new ruling on the soy moratorium adds to the retreat. “Tearing up this agreement on the eve of the Cop30 climate talks sends completely the wrong signal to the world,” Tanya Steele, WWF-UK’s chief executive, said. “This is a perilous development that puts a decade-long agreement to protect the Amazon in the bin and would have a far-reaching impact on UK and global companies too. This suspension has to be reversed. After a summer of fires and extreme heat experienced right across the world, now more than ever we need to be safeguarding the Amazon.” Much of the political pressure has come from Mato Grosso state, the soya bean capital of Brazil, which last year revoked tax incentives for companies engaged in agreements such as the soy moratorium. Industry group Aprosoja Mato Grosso welcomed the “historic” decision against what it called “a private agreement without legal support [that] has been imposing unfair trade barriers on farmers”. David Cleary, a retired NGO director involved with the Amazon since the 1980s, says soya bean producers want more land to expand production and to increase the value of their assets in the Amazon. He estimates that about 10m hectares (25m acres) – about the size of Portugal – could be suitable for legal clearance for soya if the moratorium is revoked, pushing up the value of that land by fivefold. Many expect protracted legal challenges on the grounds that the moratorium cannot be considered a cartel. In the meantime, conservationists urge soya bean traders to continue with the principles of the moratorium on an individual basis for the sake of their international reputations. There is strong support among consumers for Amazon protection. A WWF poll earlier this year found 70% of Britons support government action to remove illegal deforestation from UK supply chains. “Consumers and retailers have a vital role to play,” said Bel Lyon of WWF-UK. “Market demand must not allow the profits of a few to fuel ecosystem collapse and price instability. Forests are essential for food and energy security, offering climate and health benefits in an increasingly unstable world.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon"}

Scientists said the paper, published in Nature Plants on Thursday, was welcome confirmation that big trees are proving more climate resilient than previously believed, and undisturbed tropical vegetation continues to act as an effective carbon sink despite rising temperatures and strong droughts. However, the authors warned this vital role was increasingly at risk from fires, fragmentation and land clearance caused by the expansion of roads and farms. “It is good news but it is qualified good news,” said Prof Oliver Phillips from the University of Leeds. “Our results apply only to intact, mature forests, which is where we are watching closely. They suggest the Amazon forest is remarkably resilient to climate change. My fear is that may count for little, unless we can stop the deforestation itself.” This caution comes as Brazil plans to pave a major road – the BR-319 – through the central Amazon, close to one of the last regions that still has large areas of pristine forest. Bolivia also continues to clear trees at an alarming rate for soy plantations and cattle ranching. The study was conducted by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the UK and beyond, who examined changes in the forest at 188 plots in the Amazon over the past 30 years. They found the mean cross-section of trunks thickened by 3.3% per decade, with the greatest increase found in larger trees. This expansion was attributed to the rising amount of CO2 in the atmosphere as a result of the human-caused burning of gas, oil and coal. Big trees such as castanheiras (Brazil nut trees), sumaúmas (kapoks) and Angelim vermelho can rise up above 30 metres so they dominate the canopy and lead the competition among plants for the light, water and nutrients needed to photosynthesise CO2. The results highlight how the best-protected areas of the forest remain important allies in the struggle to stabilise the climate, though they alone are far from enough to deal with all of the extra carbon dioxide being pumped into the air globally by cars, factories and power stations. They also show the importance of preventing further deforestation. The areas of the Amazon that have been heavily fragmented by agribusiness and infrastructure – mostly in the south-east – have already shifted from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Big trees are more vulnerable to strong wind, fire and drought if they are isolated or left on the edge of a border between forest and cropland or pasture. For decades, it had been assumed that huge trees – even in dense forest – would die more quickly as temperatures rose, because they were thought to have relatively shallow roots compared with their size. But recent studies show that many have very thin roots that can suck water from much greater depths. It is not yet clear how mortality trends might have been affected by the severe drought of the past few years in much of the Amazon. One of the lead authors of the new paper, Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert from the University of Cambridge, said the big trees were disproportionately important to the functioning of the biome. Although they account for just 1% of the trees in the forest, they were responsible for 50% of the carbon cycling and storage, and probably a similar proportion of the water cycling. “Forests get much drier after big trees die. It alters the structure of the forest and it takes a long time to bounce back because the big trees take a long time to grow,” Esquivel-Muelbert said. “So it is a little bit hopeful that we find them increasing in size and number across the Amazon. There is some resilience there.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon"}

The 3,568MW plant, built to provide power for 45 million people, released a muddy torrent that flooded his neighbourhood, forcing 120 families to evacuate. “The river has gone out of control. We used to know when it would flood and when it would dry up. Now nobody knows any more,” says Nascimento, a rancher. “What men call progress has killed our history.” His is a sad tale, but not uncommon in the Amazon, where public works driven by political ambition and economic upswing have replaced the wilderness with boom towns, highways, dams and farms. While these projects have brought paved roads, electricity and jobs, they have also caused upheaval through disorderly urbanisation, organised crime, rapid deforestation and climate disruption. Fuelled by undaunted farmers and pioneering crop science, the soya bean industry has spread deep into the Amazon, blanketing the land, filling silos, helping convert Brazil into the world’s leading exporter and propelling the country’s agribusiness-boosted GDP. Studies show that transport of soya beans and maize in the so-called Amazon arc – the infrastructure for hauling crops – grew 4.8% in the past year and by 288% in the past 10 years. As the agricultural belt expands, it is reshaping the map of the Amazonian environment, infrastructure, commerce, politics and livelihoods. Brazil is now one of the world’s most bounteous agricultural producers, driven by harvests in the Cerrado, or central scrublands, and more recently in the Amazon biome. Soya beans are now cultivated in 25 of Brazil’s 27 states and cover more than half the nation’s arable land, from the pampas to the equator. In the first five months of 2025, Brazil became the top soya bean exporter with 51.53m tonnes, a 4.93% increase from the same period of 2024. Nearly 80% of soya beans are used for livestock and aquaculture, as China, the main buyer, uses 85% for animal feed, linking rising global meat demand to Brazil’s expanding exports. Three decades ago, only four of the nine Amazonian states planted soya beans. Today, all nine do, helping to make the legume Brazil’s fastest-growing commodity. Mato Grosso, a huge state that straddles the Cerrado and the Amazon, is the nation’s top producer. In Rondônia, soya bean cultivation has more than doubled since 2019, as has the economy. Under increasing public pressure, traders and big producers of the beans signed a “soya moratorium” in 2006, committing to forgo buying and selling soya beans grown on Amazonian plots deforested after 2008. In 2023, the European Commission went further, not only banning the sale of soya beans – and six other commodity crops – harvested from recently cleared Amazonian lands, but also requiring buyers to prove their imports were deforestation-free. The good news for agribusiness is that the tighter restrictions have not curtailed productivity. According to the latest report on the Amazon soya bean moratorium, although 95.6% of the expansion occurred in areas that were already affected by human activity before 2008, 16% of the area used to grow soya beans in the Amazon was cleared after the ban, and cultivation in untouched forest nearly tripled from 2018 to 2023, reaching 250,000 hectares (620,000 acres). These figures used to be controversial in Brazil – a cause for celebration for large producers and denounced by environmentalists, who are preparing for Cop30, the critical UN climate conference in November. Amazonian growers, however, continued to grumble that the soya moratorium was too prohibitive and violated free enterprise. They claimed that the rule barred land clearing even when another law permitted it – under Brazil’s 2012 forestry code, Amazonian farms may deforest up to 20% of their property. Last year, three Amazonian governors, led by Rondônia’s Marcos Rocha, passed laws cancelling tax breaks to signatories of the moratorium, alleging the pact amounted to a soya cartel. They drew praise from local farmers, many of whom had been caught out clearing forest for planting. Brazil’s anti-monopoly authority, Cade, agreed and, on 18 August, suspended the moratorium on the grounds that it unfairly advantaged a few big traders and farmers over medium and small-scale soya bean producers. A federal judge promptly overruled the antitrust board, and reinstated the moratorium. But with the agricultural lobby flexing its muscles in Brasília, the quarrel is far from over. Even if the moratorium holds, risks to the rainforest and its inhabitants remain. *** Nascimento – Zé Pereira to friends and family – has a front-row seat watching the soya bean boom. After shuttling between cheap hotels for nearly a year, he resettled in a small villa 16 miles (25km) from Porto Velho. Though he is not at risk of losing another home, the retired 70-year-old has watched uneasily as the land around him is surrendered to soya beans. “They invaded our land,” says Nascimento. “But because we hadn’t built on our lot, they moved in, planted soya beans right up to the fence, and stayed.” The cash crop has encircled his neighbourhood, overrun a local cemetery and now stretches to the horizon. Some days, the air is so thick with clouds of herbicides and pesticides that he can taste it. First, there’s “the tingling sensation” in his face. Then comes “the dizziness” and “difficulty breathing”, he says. “It’s not just me. Everyone over here feels it.” To planters, this is the scent of progress. Although most soya bean farmers are opportunists rather than villains in Amazon predation, the European Commission has traced strong indirect links between clearcutting and soya sowing. This is the case in Mato Grosso, where mechanised farms typically take over spent pasture, displacing ranchers such as Nascimento into pristine areas of neighbouring Pará, in the eastern Amazon basin. That pattern also drives up the price of forested land, in the expectation of future gains once the trees are gone – “even though soya bean is planted years after”, the European Commission concluded. Critically, however, even if no more trees fall to farmers, expanding soya bean plantations fuel the lobby’s demands for bigger and better infrastructure to store and ship their harvest to international markets. Hence the clamour to lay more asphalt, dredge rivers, build bridges and ports, and put down rails to haul ever bigger loads over already strained Amazonian transport networks. Take the BR-364, the main highway connecting western Amazonia to ports on the Atlantic coast, where every harvest brings traffic to a standstill. “We see 3,000 to 4,000 soya [articulated truck] rigs a day pass through Porto Velho,” says Adélio Barofaldi, chief executive of Rovema, a logistics company in Rondônia. “We are talking about 200km of gridlock every day.” To ease bottlenecks, the federal government recently privatised part of the highway, with plans to duplicate a critical 60-mile stretch, tellingly nicknamed the “Agro North route”. All to the detriment of the wilderness. A study found that nearly 95% of Amazon deforestation in Brazil falls within 3 miles of highways. In the Colombian Amazon, 80% of forest clearance occurs within less than 5 miles of roads. But roads lead to more roads. A recent study comparing the knock-on effects of highways in tropical regions found that every mile of official “first-cut road” in the Amazon basin generated another 30 miles of secondary roads. And much more clearcutting and degradation happened around secondary tracks than official routes. Soya’s success in the Americas is a cautionary tale, says Sandro Dutra e Silva, an environmental historian at Goiás State University studying the Cerrado. “Tropical agriculture has been hailed as a miracle, transforming Brazil into a farming power,” he says. However, because the savanna sits on South America’s key aquifers, overproduction could disrupt watersheds and weather. “The risk is that this technological triumph might hypnotise people into destroying the Cerrado and Amazonia,” Dutra says. Alexandre Nepomuceno, head of soya bean research at Embrapa, Brazil’s national agricultural institute – which developed soya strains that thrived in the tropics, boosting the seed’s use in the Amazon – cautions against vilifying scientific achievement for policy shortcomings. He says the same enterprising scientific tradition that brought harvests to the equator can also help Amazonian growers tread more lightly on the land. Mariangela Hungria, a Brazilian soil microbiology expert, won the 2025 World Food prize for her research into strains of bacteria that suck nitrogen from the air and attach it to the roots of soya beans, all but eliminating the need to import costly petroleum-based fertilisers. Last year, such biological nitrogen fixation delivered Brazil a bumper crop, saved $25m (£18.5m) in imported fertiliser, and avoided emitting 230m tons of climate-warming carbon into the atmosphere. Nepomuceno says that cutting-edge research can show the way. Still, science alone cannot save the Amazon. According to him, that is a job for policymakers, lawmakers and the public authorities that make the rules and enforce the red lines. “Given that Brazil already has plenty of deforested areas,” Nepomuceno says, “we have no need of clearing more land to grow soya beans.” • This article was amended on 29 September 2025 to include additional context regarding the use of soya beans for animal and fish feed.", "section": "Global development", "query": "Amazon"}

Prime Vision will offer a version of broadcast coverage in which datapoints will be overlaid on to live play, enabling fans to see a player’s name, their running speed, the distance of a pass and even the passing options as part of the extra information. The service will be unveiled in the UK on Tuesday night for the Tottenham v Villarreal league-phase game and will run alongside traditional coverage. Alex Green, the managing director of Prime Video Sport international, said the offering would “raise the bar for football fans and offer something meaningfully different” and that there would be further innovation “in the years to come”. Viewers in Germany and Italy will be able to access it from the Champions League’s third matchday. Amazon’s new approach has been imported from the US, where Prime Vision has operated successfully on NFL coverage for three years. For the viewer it essentially recreates the experience of watching an analyst explain a match using a telecaster, but in real-time. Further data points captured by Prime Vision include shot speed, jump height and the position of all 22 players on the pitch (displayed in a graphic at the bottom of the screen). The xG of each goalscoring opportunity will also be captured and displayed, putting a metric new to the game a decade ago at the heart of coverage. Amazon has built its own xG model and designed an algorithm that will calculate “momentum” in a match, another live stat. Andrew Hornett, Prime Video’s director of live sports production for Europe, said the innovation was optional for viewers but showed that Amazon was trying to “innovate with a purpose”. He also acknowledged the influence of games such as EA Sports’s FC in developing a more data-led way to watch. “Gaming has had an influence and [Prime Vision] has been developed by gamers,” he said. “But we haven’t defined a target audience, we’ve done it because we think it’s a cool thing to do.” Prime Vision has been a success in the US, where it won an Emmy for outstanding interactive experience in 2023. In the following year audiences for Amazon’s NFL coverage grew by 11%. Internal figures also show that the audience for Amazon’s NFL coverage was on average nearly seven years younger than that watching a linear broadcast on TV, and that on Prime Vision the audience was almost equally split between NFL obsessives and those who knew little about the sport. Amazon is a fringe player in UK sports broadcasting but its roster is growing and the tech company is able to reach sizeable audiences with its coverage; last season four of its Champions League matches reached audiences of more than 5 million people. Hornett said Amazon’s technological expertise allowed it to innovate at pace and that “it will take our rivals a bit of time to get where we are” in relation to Prime Vision. Green said the new developments showed Amazon was “here to stay” in sports. “Rights holders love our approach to their sport, the care we show and the real deep analysis we carry out,” he said. “It’s not just innovations, it’s streaming quality, it’s the low latency [delay]. I think what we can say is that we have truly established ourselves as one of the leading sports broadcasters across the world.” • This article was amended on 16 September 2025 because an earlier version referred to figures for NFL coverage showing that the Prime Vision audience was on average nearly seven years younger than that watching a linear broadcast; this relates to all viewers of their NFL coverage, not just those on Prime Vision.", "section": "Football", "query": "Amazon"}

The biggest owner of datacentres in the world, Amazon dwarfs competitors Microsoft and Google and is planning a huge increase in capacity as part of a push into artificial intelligence. The Seattle firm operates hundreds of active facilities, with many more in development despite concerns over how much water is being used to cool their vast arrays of circuitry. Amazon defends its approach and has taken steps to manage how efficient its water use is, but it has faced criticism over transparency. Microsoft and Google regularly publish figures for their water consumption, but Amazon has never publicly disclosed how much water its server farms consume. When designing a campaign for water efficiency, the company’s cloud computing division chose to account for only a smaller water usage figure that does not include all the ways its datacentres use water so as to minimise the risk to its reputation, according to a leaked memo seen by SourceMaterial and the Guardian. Amazon as a whole consumed 105bn gallons of water in total in 2021, as much as 958,000 US households, which would make for a city bigger than San Francisco, according to the memo. Asked about the leaked document, Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan described it as “obsolete” and said it “completely misrepresents Amazon’s current water usage strategy”. “A document’s existence doesn’t guarantee its accuracy or finality,” she said. “Meetings often reshape documents or reveal flawed findings or claims.” Callahan would not elaborate on which strategic elements of the document were “obsolete”. The memo was dated one month before Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing division, debuted a new sustainability campaign in November 2022 called “Water Positive”, with a commitment to “return more water than it uses” by 2030. In the memo, ahead of the campaign’s launch, executives grappled with whether to include public disclosures about “secondary” use – water used in generating the electricity to power its datacentres. They warned that full transparency was “a one-way door” and advised keeping AWS’s projections confidential, even as they feared that their advice could invite accusations of a cover-up. “Amazon hides its water consumption” was one negative headline the authors anticipated. Callaghan said efficiency savings have already been achieved and pointed out that other companies also don’t count secondary water use. Executives opted to use only the relatively smaller figure of primary use, 7.7bn gallons per year, roughly equivalent to 11,600 Olympic swimming pools, when calculating progress towards internal targets because of “reputational risk”, fearing bad publicity if the full scale of Amazon’s consumption was revealed, the document shows. Ultimately as part of the campaign for water efficiency, Amazon aimed to cut its estimated 7.7bn gallon primary consumption to 4.9bn by 2030 – without addressing secondary use. Using the higher of two water usage estimates, the one that would include secondary use, “would double the size and budget” of the campaign “without addressing meaningful operational, regulatory or reputational risks”, they warned, adding that there was “no focus from customers or media” on water used for electricity. “We may decide to release water volumes in the future,” the document said. “But … we should only do so if the lack of data undermines the programme or is required by regulators.” Scientists balked at the selective disclosure and the choice not to include secondary use of water in the total. “In environmental science, it is standard practice to include both to more accurately capture the true water cost of datacentres,” said Shaolei Ren, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside. Amazon’s Water Positive campaign is still active and does not take into account secondary use, while the company continues to keep its current overall water consumption confidential. As US tech companies ride the wave of AI investment and pursue greater heights of computational power, the $2.4tn corporation is building new datacentres in some of the world’s driest areas, SourceMaterial and the Guardian revealed in April. Feeling water positive In November 2022, AWS debuted its new Water Positive sustainability campaign, with a commitment to “return more water than it uses by 2030”. The campaign only applies to AWS. The wider Amazon group, including the world’s biggest online retail business, has an overall water consumption that is far higher, 105bn gallons per year. “The models referenced in this document were preliminary and unvetted,” said Amazon’s Callahan, who declined to provide any alternative figures. The document’s authors advised the company not to release data about the wider company, but they also warned that selective disclosure could lead to accusations of a cover-up. There was “reputational risk of publicly committing to a goal for only a portion of Amazon’s direct water footprint”, they wrote. They even suggested negative headlines that might result including “Amazon disappoints, failing to take full responsibility for water”. “It would be better if they could own up to it,” said a current Amazon software developer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “Even if they said it was a low priority, at least that would be honest.” In a sustainability report in August, AWS claimed it had achieved 53% of its Water Positive goal. The division’s plan for reaching the target relies mostly on “water replenishment” projects, some in partnership with Water.org, a non-profit organisation co-founded by actor Matt Damon. The strategy document refers to these projects as “offsets”, describing initiatives like using Amazon computer technology to help utilities prioritise which pipes to fix in order to minimise leaks. But of the $109m AWS planned to spend on offsets, around half would have been spent anyway, either to meet regulatory requirements or because the projects would help AWS operations by making water more available, the document shows. Experts said this amounted to incomplete accounting. “Regardless of what sort of offsetting or replenishment you do, it doesn’t necessarily nullify the water footprints of your own operations,” said Tyler Farrow, standards manager at the Alliance for Water Stewardship. “Calling your operations water positive or water neutral is misleading.” Amazon’s Callahan said that the “replenishment spending”, which other tech companies also undertake, is a voluntary, not a regulatory, requirement. “We’ve expanded well beyond what was imagined in the document because it’s the right thing to do for the world and for the communities in which we operate,” she said. ‘Obfuscate the water footprint’ Amazon is also engineering industry standards to downplay its water use and avert scrutiny, said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at the company. The corporation has funded efforts by the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources Institute non-profits, alongside LimnoTech, a consultancy, “to create a globally accepted methodology for quantifying the benefit of watershed restoration projects”. Responding to questions from SourceMaterial, all three organisations defended their integrity and independence, insisting that Amazon had no undue influence on any methodologies they had created. “They spend a lot of time creating methodologies that are used to obfuscate the water footprint,” Wangusi said, referring to Amazon. Callahan said Wangusi’s claim was “contradicted by facts”. “Amazon’s water use reporting is based on third-party assured data from actual utility bills, not estimates or self-reporting,” she said. Wangusi’s claim, though, was not about Amazon’s water-use reporting, but about measuring the effects of water offsets. Callahan said these efforts were “standard practice” and that Amazon’s “customers expect us to hold ourselves accountable to credible guidance and best practices”. As well as choosing not to disclose water use from electricity generation, Amazon has estimated its larger “indirect” water footprint, the document shows. This extra usage, which falls under a classification known as “scope 3”, includes water for production and construction – in Amazon’s case, mostly irrigation of cotton plantations supplying its fashion brands, and vegetables for its grocery arm, Amazon Fresh. Here, too, Amazon decided to keep its consumption confidential, even though “indirect water use represents roughly 90% of Amazon’s total water footprint”, according to the document. AWS avoided establishing targets for indirect water use because that figure would be “much more significant for the rest of Amazon, especially in the agricultural supply chain, and the team does not want to establish a standard for addressing scope 3 water use that the rest of Amazon would need to follow, given the larger resource implications”, the authors wrote. “You don’t need to obscure or obfuscate,” said Wangusi, who believes he was “hounded out” of Amazon for criticising the company’s approach. (Amazon declined to comment on his departure.) “It doesn’t make you more profitable,” he said. “It makes you less trustworthy.”", "section": "Technology", "query": "Amazon"}

It is worth remembering that the word “ayahuasca” itself is not a modern invention, but a Quechua term meaning “vine of the soul”. It is just one of many names used for the ceremonial medicine across different Indigenous cultures – others include yagé, kamarampi, caapi, oasca and daime. Suggesting that only “hayakwaska” is “correct” erases the diversity of ancestral traditions across the Amazon basin. The claim that ayahuasca is marketed as a “mystical shortcut” overlooks the reality: real work with this medicine is neither quick nor easy. True healing through ayahuasca involves deep inner effort, often accompanied by discomfort, surrender and courage – whether one is Indigenous or not. The criticism of cultural distortion and biodiversity loss is valid, especially that tourism encourages the illegal wildlife trade. But we must also acknowledge that many of the products sold to tourists (such as jaguar parts) are offered by local individuals. Given their cultural knowledge and connection to the forest, Indigenous communities can and should take leadership in educating both locals and visitors, promoting sustainable and ethical practices. To ask, “How are ‘ayahuasca tourists’ giving back?” is fair. Yet tourism – when done responsibly – can be a vital source of income for rural areas, offering alternatives to logging, mining and drug trafficking. It provides jobs and preserves cultural relevance for younger generations. Enrico Malatesta Wanay Community Retreat Center, Mocoa, Colombia • I agree wholeheartedly with Nina Gualinga and Eli Virkina that ayahuasca tourism takes the shaman away from their sacred work, which is the community and the land. I know that as a UK-based shamanic healer, my work is with this land. This is what brings harmony to the soul. The plants and trees of any country are the wisdom keepers and healing cannot happen anywhere unless the land is being tended and healed. This involves releasing the souls of war and empire-building, reinstating the guardians of the sacred sites and bringing ourselves back to reciprocity. Knowing our roots and tending them brings us back into relationship with ourselves. This land and our hearts need our ancestral tending right now. For our healing to involve going to Ecuador for spiritual tourism, when there is so much ancestral and earth tending to do on our soil, shows how disconnected we still are from land and mother. We cannot find that anywhere else. The plants of these sacred isles hold so much love and wisdom now in our return to the land as a mother, as a sentient loving source who holds us. The sacred plants of these isles are dandelions, thistles, dock and nettle – they support us and guide us. Our trees are oak, birch and rowan, hawthorn. It is our communication and relationship with the earth mother and the plant spirits. A sovereign connection between ourselves and our earth. Emily Webster Lancaster • It’s always fascinating to learn about such distant remote Indigenous communities, and yet find so much in common, such as their innate respect for nature. The onset of modern tourism – often appended with “eco”, “sustainable” and “responsible” by those exploiting Indigenous people – is a common phenomenon. However, is there a lesser of two evils? “Ayahuasca” in Ecuador, as described in your piece, or the wholesale taking-over of Indigenous lands, livelihoods and cultures that we see in Cambodia? The forced assimilation in to the mainstream population was most violently imposed during the notorious 1970s Khmer Rouge regime but goes on insidiously ever since.

Ricardo Teixeira, the owner of Love Lomas, said a “de-eroticization” campaign was in full swing as motels – traditionally used for passionate rendezvous between lovers – stepped into the breach to help authorities cope with the huge influx of outsiders for November’s Cop30 summit. Mirrored ceilings, pole dancing poles and sex chairs resembling a cross between a torture rack and a weight bench were being covered or removed. Mattresses were being changed and kitsch erotic artwork being stored away to ensure bashful conference-goers felt at home. “There’s a certain stigma [attached to motels] … because they charge by the hour … but the only difference is that they’re mostly used for romantic liaisons,” said Teixeira, urging delegates to make a booking at his 48-room drive-in, just around the corner from Cop’s main venue and directly opposite the environment secretariat. Teixeira insisted love-makers were not the only ones who frequented his motel, where bedside menus offer condoms and caipirinhas and there is a £1 surcharge for dirty sheets. During Covid, frontline health workers rented rooms to avoid infecting their families. Business travellers from the interior of Pará, a state the size of South Africa of which Belém is capital, sometimes used its air-conditioned chambers. “People still have the wrong idea about motels … that outdated image from TV and films that they are brothels,” complained Teixeira, who said visiting delegates were welcome to keep the erotic chairs, if they wished. “You never know, do you?” The love motel community’s efforts to support the climate summit comes at a delicate moment for Brazil’s government which is facing a backlash over the failure to sufficiently improve Belém’s hotel infrastructure since President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced the city would host Cop30 two years ago. The lack of accommodation has caused a jaw-dropping surge in prices, with rooms hard to come by, even now. One report showed a budget hotel had hiked its rates from about £10 per night in 2023 to nearly £800 during the gathering, which is set to take place between 10 and 21 November. Earlier this month Austria said its president and negotiators would not attend the Amazon’s first-ever Cop summit citing “particularly high costs”. Some diplomats have even suggested partially relocating the event although Brazilian officials insist there is no “plan B”. In an open letter, the Climate Observatory watchdog warned the summit risked being “the most exclusionary in history” with civil society, representatives of developing nations and the press priced out. “A poorly attended Cop would be, as well as a historic humiliation for Brazil, a precious opportunity missed at a moment when we have just five years to keep the [Paris] climate agreement’s temperature target alive,” it said. So far, just 30% of the nearly 200 countries that are part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have reportedly managed to confirm bookings in Belém. Márcio Astrini, the Observatory’s director, voiced frustration that the lack of accommodation had supplanted the climate breakdown as the main topic of debate. “Fossil fuels is the key discussion we should have on the agenda right now … How is the world going to organize so there is a plan to transition away from fossil fuels? “[But] to have a negotiation about transitioning … you need to have a room full of negotiators … If the negotiators are saying they won’t come, how are you going to negotiate these topics? It simply won’t happen,” Astrini said. Addressing complaints over the lack of lodging earlier this year, Lula declared: “If there isn’t a five star hotel [available], sleep in a four-star one. If there isn’t a four-star one, sleep in a three-star one. If there isn’t a three-star one, sleep looking up at the stars … and it will be wonderful.” Authorities plan to deploy two cruise ships to serve as floating hotels for about 6,000 visitors. Belém’s sex moteliers have another solution in mind for policy wonks, ambassadors and reporters struggling to find affordable beds. “They are welcome here,” enthused Teixeira, who is the regional representative of the Brazilian Motel Association. Teixeira said motel bosses had so far offered to make nearly 600 of their estimated 2,050 rooms available for the summit. Cristiano Ribeiro, the 51-year-old owner of a motel called Só Prazer (Pleasure Only), has rented eight of its 33 rooms to Cop-goers through a government website. Guests will pay $200 a night, or $280 for rooms with jacuzzis. Ribeiro’s father, a truck driver who migrated to Belém in the 70s, founded Pleasure Only in 1995 – the year Cop’s first meeting was held in Berlin. Initially called Ponto G (G-spot), the motel changed its name to Pleasure Only after a copyright complaint from a rival. As he showed off his açaí palm-flanked premises, Ribeiro celebrated how Cop was transforming his culturally rich but economically disadvantaged home town. “It’s wonderful. We’ve progressed 30 years in one,” he said of the hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure investments that have turned much of the city into a construction site. Ribeiro has paid a graffiti artist to cover his roadside motel with murals celebrating the Amazon’s wildlife and Indigenous peoples, hoping foreign visitors would enjoy their stay. By the time they arrived, the adult channels on its televisions would have been deactivated; the sex shop selling nurses’ costumes removed; and the laminated catalogues offering furry handcuffs and “Real Peter” dildos replaced by English-language menus offering food. Pole dancing poles could be used as coat hangers. Climate negotiators would receive a warm reception. “We’ve all kinds of clients,” Ribeiro said as a pair of lovers swept into Pleasure Only on motorbike for a lunchtime romp. “We welcome them all.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon"}

The affected platforms included Snapchat, Roblox, Signal and Duolingo as well as a host of Amazon-owned operations including its main retail site and the Ring doorbell company. More than 2,000 companies worldwide have been affected, according to Downdetector, a site that monitors internet outages, with 8.1m reports of problems from users including 1.9m reports in the US, 1m in the UK and 418,000 in Australia. Many of the sites were restored after a few hours, but some experienced persistent problems throughout the day. By Monday evening, Amazon said all of its cloud services had “returned to normal operations”. In the UK, Lloyds bank was affected, as well as its subsidiaries Halifax and Bank of Scotland, while there were also problems accessing the HM Revenue and Customs website on Monday morning. Also in the UK, Ring users complained on social media that their doorbells were not working. In the UK alone, reports of problems on individual apps ran into the tens of thousands for each platform. Other affected platforms around the world included Wordle, Coinbase, Duolingo, Slack, Pokémon Go, Epic Games, PlayStation Network and Peloton. By 10.30am UK time, Amazon was reporting that the problem, which first emerged at about 8am, was being resolved as AWS was “seeing significant signs of recovery”. However, after reporting further positive progress by late morning in the UK, Amazon still appeared to be struggling to overcome the glitch this afternoon as it acknowledged it was still experiencing elevated errors. “We can confirm significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services … We are investigating,” AWS said in an update at about 7am Pacific time and 3pm UK time. To aid the recovery, AWS said it was putting in place limits on the number of requests that could be made on its platform. Experts said the outage underlined the dangers of the internet’s reliance on a small number of tech companies, with Amazon, Microsoft and Google playing a key role in the cloud market. Dr Corinne Cath-Speth, the head of digital at human rights organisation Article 19, said: “We urgently need diversification in cloud computing. The infrastructure underpinning democratic discourse, independent journalism and secure communications cannot be dependent on a handful of companies.” Cori Crider, the executive director of the Future of Technology Institute, a thinktank that supports a sovereign technology framework for Europe, said: “The UK can’t keep leaving its critical infrastructure at the mercy of US tech giants. With Amazon Web Services down, we’ve seen the lights go out across the modern economy – from banking to communications.” Madeline Carr, professor of global politics and cybersecurity at University College London, said it was “hard to disagree” with warnings about the over-reliance of the global internet on a small number of companies. “The counter-argument is that it’s these large hyper-scaling companies that have the financial resources to provide a secure, global and resilient service. But most people outside those companies would argue that is a risky position for the world to be in.” Last year, airports, healthcare services and businesses worldwide were hit by the “largest outage in history”, caused by a botched software upgrade from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike that hit Microsoft’s Windows operating system. Amazon reported that the problem on Monday originated in the east coast of the US at Amazon Web Services, a unit that provides vital web infrastructure for a host of companies, which rent out space on Amazon servers. AWS is the world’s largest cloud computing platform. Shortly after midnight (PDT) in the US (8am BST) on Monday, Amazon confirmed “increased error rates and latencies” for AWS services in a region on the east coast of the US. The ripple effect hit services around the world, with Downdetector reporting problems with the same sites in multiple continents. Cisco’s Thousand Eyes, a service that tracks internet outages, also reported a surge in problems on Monday morning, with many of them located in Virginia, the location of Amazon’s US-East-1 region, where AWS said the problems began and where AWS has a number of datacentres. Experts said the outage appeared to be an IT issue rather than a cyber-attack. AWS’s online health dashboard referred to DynamoDB, its database system where AWS customers store their data. Amazon appeared to rule out foul play, saying the root cause was an internal subsystem responsible for monitoring its load balancers, which prevent traffic from overloading its servers. “The incident appears to have been caused by some accident within AWS, rather than being the result of any malicious intent,” said Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London. The UK government has said it is in contact with Amazon over the outage. A spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.” The House of Commons’ treasury committee in the UK has written to the economic secretary to the Treasury, Lucy Rigby, to ask why the government had not yet designated Amazon a “critical third party” to the UK’s financial services sector – which would expose the tech firm to financial regulatory oversight. The committee chair, Meg Hillier, pointed out that Amazon had recently told the committee that financial services customers were using AWS to support their “resilience” and that AWS offered “multiple layers of protection”.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Amazon"}

Don’t expect Amazon to replace it", "date": null, "author": "Niamh Rowe", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "In towns where Washington DC is an abstraction, the post office is the front desk of American democracy – sometimes the only public space at all. Here, postmasters are “the human side of government”, as the senator Jennings Randolph put it in 1976. “When such offices are closed,” he warned, “the American flag really comes down.” Championed by Benjamin Franklin in 1775, the roots of the US postal service – whose mandate is to “bind the nation together” – are older than the republic itself. The constitution calls for “post offices and post roads”. The USPS is still legally obligated to provide a “basic and fundamental” service to all Americans. In Scottsbluff, Nebraska, a rural carrier drives more than 700 miles a year to serve just two households. But after years in the red – and amid open hostility from the Trump administration – its future looks uncertain. The USPS has lost about $114bn since 2007, according to financial reports, amid declining letter volume, competition from private carriers and rising employee costs. Meanwhile, the specter of privatization looms larger than ever. “The postal service is a joke,” Donald Trump told reporters in 2020. A reform plan during his previous administration called for restructuring it “to return it to a sustainable business model or prepare it for future conversion from a Government agency into a privately-held corporation”. Given this historical scorn, it was no surprise when reports broke in February that Trump was considering dissolving the agency’s leadership and absorbing it into the Department of Commerce. “The fate of the USPS is no longer financial or managerial, but political,” James O’Rourke, a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, recently told me. “Putting the post office up for an IPO would not be much of a stretch in the current climate. The checks and balances are gone.” Indeed, a Wells Fargo memo to investors titled “USPS Privatization: A Framework” was leaked last month. It reads: “Parcel could be carved out and sold or IPOed.” The plan predicts parcel prices would increase 30%–140% across product lines and proposes a post office sell-off so that “value can be harvested” from the real estate. Yet if the parcel segment were “carved out”, not all of the carcass would bear meat. Investors will seize only the parts they can further monetize, O’Rourke says. That would mean closing small-town post offices and ending home delivery on unprofitable routes. Think of the mule train that descends into Havasupai territory in the Grand Canyon; the small aircraft and seasonal boats that serve Little Diomede, Alaska, where residents can see Russia from their windows; or Point Roberts, Washington, where mail crosses Canada to reach a US town. If universal service falters, those addresses are likely to be abandoned first. People in affected zip codes – already more likely to be lower income – will have to travel to pick up parcels or pay steep delivery costs. “Those people will do with less or do without,” O’Rourke says. But the cost of losing universal service would be more than financial. Vote-by-mail and absentee ballots are particularly critical in rural areas with distant polling stations, and the USPS ensures those ballots reach voters. It also handles 1.2bn prescription-drug shipments each year, as of 2020, according to the National Association of Letter Carriers union. In places with no nearby banks, the post office may be the only location where residents can pay bills. Rural postal workers also fulfill a civic role that transcends transporting mail. A study of village postmasters from the 1970s illustrates how closely woven they can become into civic life: “People going out of town commonly leave their house keys with the postmaster … residents leave notes with the postmaster for friends to retrieve later in the day.” While the advent of the internet renders that depiction somewhat antiquated, its essence remains true. “Rural carriers are still the fabric that knits some communities together,” Don Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, told me. In some towns, carriers may be the only contact residents have with the outside world – and thus a lifeline, he added. Carriers still carry out “wellness checks” if a resident fails to collect their mail. Mark Jamison spent 15 years as a postmaster in a remote office in the mountains of North Carolina, where he was the town’s only government worker. Many residents were not literate, so he assisted with written tasks. Older residents would stop by the post office on their way home so he could open their jars. He assembled bicycles at Christmas. Locals referred to him as the “bartender”, because people came in with stories to tell and advice to seek. “There are still postal employees who do that,” Jamison said. While the USPS has staved off a formal sell-off so far under the current administration, its universal service is already being eroded in de facto terms. This year, its 10-year “Delivering for America” modernization plan kicks off in a bid to save at least $36 billion. The plan will slow service for about three-quarters of the country’s zip codes, according to the advocacy group Save the Post Office, with rural areas bearing the brunt. The Postal Regulatory Commission voiced opposition to the plan in January, noting it was “very concerned” about how it would disadvantage rural communities. Louis DeJoy, the former US postmaster general, announced a plan in March to cut 10,000 USPS jobs. Amid reports Trump urged the USPS board of governors to appoint FedEx board member David P Steiner as postmaster general, Brian Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, alleged a “hostile takeover” of the postal service. (Steiner, who took the job in July, has said he does not believe the USPS should be privatized and that he believes “in the current structure of the postal service as a self-financing, independent entity of the executive branch”.) At the same time, Amazon Logistics is on track to surpass the USPS as the nation’s largest parcel carrier by volume. The company is also speeding up in rural America, as AI-driven efficiencies make more routes economically viable. In April, it announced a $4bn investment to expand its rural “last-mile” network – tripling its size by the end of next year and reaching 13,000 more rural zip codes. This will be welcome news to those households. But Amazon drivers can’t go the extra mile. They lack the civic responsibilities of government workers, and their routes fluctuate algorithmically, meaning it’s harder to build community ties. What’s more, Amazon’s last-mile network will expand only as long as it’s profitable to do so. “I don’t see it going into the mule train business, right?” said Christopher W Shaw, author of First Class: The US Postal Service, Democracy, and the Corporate Threat. An Amazon driver will never sing the USPS’s unofficial motto: “Every piece, every address, every day.” Without a legal mandate, why would they? As one Minnesota town-hall clerk put it in the 1970s: “The post office is like drinking water.

But in an unlikely convergence of views, both the centre-right state governor and leftwing social movements insist this is a storm in a plant pot compared with the darkening geopolitical threats to the world’s biggest diplomatic gathering, which will take place in November in Belém. This tropical port, which sits on the mouth of the Amazon River, is one of the poorest cities in Brazil. It faces mounting criticism about its preparations for an international conference that is on a far greater scale than anything previously seen in the rainforest region. A shortage of beds has driven hotel prices so high that the federal government has threatened to prosecute price-gougers. Traffic congestion, already bad, is expected to become horrific with the expected influx of 50,000 visitors during the event. Conservation groups have been shocked by the clearance of forests for new highways and there is scepticism that the city’s infrastructure projects, including a doubling of the airport’s capacity, will be ready in time. But in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the Pará state governor, Helder Barbalho – who says he asked President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in November 2022 to nominate Belém as host – said everything was on track. “All the projects that were planned and structured will be ready so that we can hold a fantastic event in November,” he said. He insisted the event will be worthwhile to improve the lives of city residents and for civil society to finally be given a voice after three consecutive Cops in autocratic nations. Barbalho said: “We understand that it will be the Cop with the greatest popular participation in history and that is something we have particularly encouraged.” Belém is already a hive of construction activity, though critics claim the benefits are mainly for real estate developers and major corporations, while there is little effort to reduce economic inequality in the urban peripheries or integrate nature into urban planning Mask-wearing welders are illuminated by blue sparks at the Parque da Cidade, a former airport that will stage the main conference centre. Signs say the work here is being carried out by Brazil’s biggest mining company, Vale, which has been responsible for some of the country’s deadliest and most environmentally destructive disasters, including the 2019 collapse of the Brumadinho tailings dam, which killed 272 people. Close to the colonial-era Cidade Velha – or old town – district, a new urban park is under construction between a complex of middle-class high rises and a swanky redevelopment of old warehouses that are now upmarket restaurants selling an extraordinary range of fish dishes and ice-creams made from regional fruits. The most striking feature of the new concrete space are several dozen “eco-trees” made from recycled steel bars that branch out into canopy-like supports for pots full of hanging plants. This proved controversial when a city official admitted the designs were copied from Singapore for shade because Belém is warming rapidly and there was not enough good soil in this area to plant real trees. It confirmed what people could see and feel. Belém was once known as the city of mango trees, but has experienced a dramatic loss of urban vegetation over the past 20 years. This process has been compounded by the Cop30-accelerated expansion of two new roads – Avenida Liberdade and Rua da Marinha – that together resulted in the clearance of more than 100 hectares (247 acres) of vegetation. Ana Claudia Cardoso, a professor of urbanism at the Federal University of Pará, predicted Belém would have less tree cover in the city after Cop than it did before. Barbalho said the road improvements had been planned two years before the Cop bid and were built to high environmental standards with walls on either side to prevent roadkill and high numbers of dedicated animal crossings. He said it would reduce traffic jams and their associated carbon emissions. He preferred to focus on the bigger picture: that Pará – long a centre of Amazon destruction – is now at the forefront of efforts to reduce deforestation, which halved between 2018 and 2024. “We had the courage to build a new history,” he said, also stressing efforts to reforest faster than any other state in Brazil, secure the majority of carbon credits, initiate a cattle-tracing programme and build a “bioeconomy” by investing in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals to replace cattle ranching. Such talk – and his willingness to work with Lula, the Workers’ party president – makes Barbalho an exception among the governors of Amazonian states, almost all of whom are far-right Bolsonarists. But he shares similar extractivist roots, owning more than 6,000 cattle and shares in a ranch among his listed assets of 18.75m real (£2.48m) in 2022. The scion of the most powerful dynasty in the state (his father is a senator, media tycoon and landowner) is known as “the king of the north” and widely believed to be building his global reputation for a future bid for the presidency. Many on the left distrust Barbalho and say he overstates his achievements, which are more to do with federal policies. But there is grudging respect for his intelligence, ability to secure such a prestigious global meeting, and promise to support civil society. There is also a shared frustration at external criticism of “chaotic” Belém. Many see this as hypocrisy from the global north, which is now much more of a threat to multilateralism because conflict is worsening, rich countries have failed to provide sufficient climate finance, and Donald Trump has begun pulling the US out of the Paris agreement. Caetano Scannavino, the coordinator of the Health and Happiness Project in the Amazon, said: “More than just logistics, these are gigantic challenges for Brazil in exercising the mandate that the world gave us to lead the negotiations until November 2025. We are about to lose the battle of the 1.5C goal [of limiting global heating above preindustrial levels] of Paris, and the only consensus among the nations that claim to be leaders of humanity – the US, China, Russia and Europe – is to put more money into buying weapons.” Amid the collapsing consensus, the Brazilian chair of Cop30, ambassador André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, has proposed an agenda for governments that steers clear of contentious issues. Instead, he has called on civil society to take the lead in applying pressure. Indigenous communities have been promised a more prominent role both in the official conference venue and at a parallel four-day “people’s summit” in the university grounds that is expected to draw about 15,000 participants from traditional communities, NGOs and academia. Several demonstrations are planned, the biggest of which will be a march during the middle weekend of the conference. But there is a risk in raising expectations for protests and public meetings. Without clear mechanisms and authority for civil society to influence the official debate, protesters may feel frustrated that they are involved in little more than grandstanding. Given the Brazilian police’s widespread support for Bolsonaro and tendency to resort to teargas and violence at public gatherings, there are concerns that street conflicts could further undermine prospects for a global consensus. Barbalho said the organisers would be well prepared to avoid problems. Security is being coordinated by the federal government, who have organised a national committee with representatives from the armed forces and police. Seven hundred members of Pará’s military police are receiving special training. Some veteran activists are wary but determined. Eunice Guedes of the Brazilian Women’s Articulation said: “We are concerned that the city will be militarised and that the exclusion zone will be large. We have been talking to the city hall of Belém to define its size. Security is a concern.” But most talk of their hopes for a festive spirit, a long-term shift in local policies and a chance to show a different – and urban – side of the rainforest. Mariana Guimarães, a Belém-based environmentalist and international political adviser to the Cop30 civil society committee, said she was looking forward to challenging preconceptions – for better or for worse. She said: “I think it’s an opportunity not just for the world to know the Amazon, but also for Brazil to know the Amazon, because we understand that there are a lot of these stereotypes of what the region is, right? “Many people will come here thinking they will enter a dense forest and all that, and they will see that there will be no real trees here in Belém. Visitors will get to know another Amazon, get to know our culture, definitely enjoy the food that we have, the music and everything else.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon"}

Hosting the tens of thousands of delegates who make the trip is a big undertaking for any city. But the decision to host Cop30 in Belém, at the mouth of the Amazon river, has multiplied the complications. After three consecutive Cops in autocratic nations, the stated aim of Cop30’s chair, André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, is to make this year’s event a showcase for civil society, including the Indigenous groups and forest defenders who play such a vital role in conservation. But the lack of affordable accommodation and other infrastructure, as well as the distance that must be travelled to reach the Amazon port, mean this commendable ideal will be hard to realise. Dom Phillips’ posthumously published book, How To Save the Amazon: A Journalist’s Deadly Quest for Answers, is a compelling reminder of what is at stake. It is nearly three years since he was killed along with Bruno Pereira, a Brazilian government employee whose job was monitoring isolated Indigenous groups. The pair were on the way back from a trip to the remote Javari valley. The search and investigation were initially botched. Two men will go on trial for murder later this year. Phillips and Pereira understood the risks they ran, in struggling to document the destruction that was then taking place. Between 2019 and 2023, under the far-right presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, progress on rainforest conservation went into sharp reverse and deforested areas grew rapidly. Illegal loggers, miners and ranchers effectively had carte blanche, as the agencies tasked with upholding environmental regulations were weakened and disbanded. Over the same period, and encouraged by the government’s laissez-faire approach, competition between drug traffickers over lucrative smuggling routes intensified. Owing to its remoteness, the Javari reserve, near the border with Peru, became a key battleground. Under President Lula the situation has stabilised. His environment minister, Marina Silva, is the right person to oversee the government’s policy of zero net deforestation by 2030. But plans to expand the country’s fossil fuel production are impossible to square with these environmental goals. The risk that global heating and deforestation could cause a mass dieback of the rainforest, triggering the release of vast stores of carbon, continues to trouble scientists. At the same time, doubts are growing about whether this year’s deadline for certification of the beef supply chain as deforestation-free will be met. Under strong international pressure, JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is putting new systems in place. But the huge number of farmers (Brazil has a cattle herd of 240m), the terrain, gaps in land registration, and systems set up to bypass checks, mean the prospects for success are not high. Having the global spotlight on the forest should at least focus minds. The Amazon’s biodiversity, and role in climate regulation, make it too important to lose. Indigenous defenders, some of whom worked with Pereira and Phillips, continue the vital work of championing the landscape that is their home. The journalist’s book, completed by his friends, shows the urgency of supporting their courageous efforts. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Beef production is the primary driver of deforestation, as trees are cleared to raise cattle, and scientists warn this is pushing the Amazon close to a tipping point that would accelerate its shift from a carbon sink into a carbon emitter. JBS, the Brazil-headquartered multinational that dominates the Brazilian cattle market, promised to address this with a commitment to clean up its beef supply chain in the region by the end of 2025. In a project to understand the barriers to progress on Amazon deforestation, a team of journalists from the Guardian, Unearthed and Repórter Brasil interviewed more than 35 people, including ranchers and ranching union leaders who represent thousands of farms in the states of Pará and Rondônia. The investigation found widespread disbelief that JBS would be able to complete the groundwork and hit its deforestation targets. “They certainly have the will to do it, just as we have the will to do it,” said one rancher. But the goal that all the cattle they bought would be deforestation-free was unreachable, he said. “They say this is going to be implemented. I’d say straight away: that’s impossible.” The problem of illegal cattle laundering would also not be resolved in time, said many, while another interviewee said land ownership issues meant quite simply that the deadline was “impossible”. JBS told the Guardian that it contested the conclusions. “Drawing inferences and conclusions from a limited sample of 30 farmers while disregarding that JBS has over 40,000 registered suppliers is entirely irresponsible,” the company said in a statement. It said that “while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks.” To hit its targets, JBS needs to register all its direct and indirect suppliers and ensure none of the meat it buys from the Amazon is from cattle that has grazed on deforested land. It has established a network of “green offices” to provide free consultation to ranchers on how to comply with the three- to six-month process of regularisation, which involves drawing up a plan to plant more trees, withdrawing from contested territory, or making other environmental remediations. Then details will go into the JBS database, which continually monitors farms using artificial intelligence, and owners will be contacted if they fail to meet their obligations. In Pará, the company is also working with the state government on an ear-tagging scheme that would track the state’s entire herd of 26 million cattle by 2026. The Pará state governor, Helder Barbalho, who has supported the traceability plan, expects JBS to meet its deadline, but he acknowledged there had been resistance and that small farmers in particular would need more support. He said the Bezos Earth Fund had committed 143m reais to this task: “We are still mobilising resources so that we can finance this policy that is very important for us to present to livestock farmers.” But ranchers and rancher unions interviewed by the Guardian and its partners said that technical hurdles and uncertainties over land ownership – many ranches were created by invading public land – stood no chance of resolution by the company’s self-imposed deadline. Adelosmar Antonio Orio, known as Ticão, who works for the Tucumaã-Ourilaãndia Union of Rural Producers, said the logistical challenges, such as ranchers needing special equipment including ear trackers and satellite internet systems, would make the scheme impossible to complete before the year-end deadline. “Not even they [JBS] know how this traceability is going to be implemented,” he said. Others argued that new small- and medium-sized producers were being asked to bear most of the burden of the new system and that JBS and the government had not done enough to explain the new tracking system and provide the technological support needed to make it work. The thorny subject of land ownership would also be impossible to resolve, argued many, including Cristina Malcher, the president of the Commission of Women in Agribusiness, a national advocacy body for women in agriculture. “The deadline of 2025 is impossible to meet, because if you don’t know who owns the land, then you don’t have environmental regularity,” Malcher told the Guardian. Ticão agreed. “By the end of the year, we need to resolve all the land problems, all the environmental problems.” Could it be done in time? “Definitely not,” he said. His union colleagues expressed similar disbelief that the deadline could be met. The investigation also spoke to indirect suppliers who openly admitted to using middlemen to clean up the environmental record of their livestock, a practice known as cattle laundering. Several producers predicted that a new tracing system would lead to new loopholes, such as slaughtering the cattle elsewhere and then selling the meat – rather than live cattle – at a low price to JBS. JBS has not mapped its entire supply chain, due under its deforestation commitments by the end of this year. But the company said: “JBS has already enrolled the equivalent of over 80% of its annual cattle purchases on to a blockchain-enabled, web-based transparent farming livestock platform.” JBS has previously been linked to deforestation on a number of occasions, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit last year accusing the company of misleading consumers with its climate goals in an effort to increase sales. A bipartisan group of 15 US senators urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject JBS’s application for a share listing. “Dozens of journalistic and NGO reports have shown that JBS is linked to more destruction of forests and other ecosystems than any other company in Brazil,” they wrote in an open letter. JBS told the Guardian: “The challenges of addressing illegal deforestation on cattle operations that span millions of farms across hundreds of thousands of square kilometresare significant.” It detailed its response, which includes zero tolerance for deforestation sourcing policy, state-of-the-art supply chain monitoring, free technical assistance for producers to help regularise their farms, and the JBS Fund for the Amazon, which finances projects focused on the sustainable development of the Amazon biome. The company also said: “JBS works with farmers, ranchers and partners across the food system to develop solutions that support a growing global population while optimising resources and reducing agriculture’s environmental impact. Cattle raising in the Amazon is undergoing a sectoral transformation, and one company cannot solve all the industry’s challenges.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon"}

This is the second suit filed against the car maker this week alleging a design flaw in its vehicle is to blame for the deaths of the passengers involved in the accident, according to court filings. The parents of Jack Nelson allege that the company that helped Elon Musk become the world’s richest man knew about the flaw for years and could have moved faster to fix the problem but did not, leaving the passengers trapped amid flames and smoke that eventually killed them. “This case arises from catastrophic design defects in the Tesla Cybertruck that turned a survivable crash into a fatal fire,” reads the complaint, which was filed on Thursday in Alameda county superior court. The Nelsons are being represented by the firm Walkup, Melodia, Kelly &amp; Schoenberger. Tesla did not reply to a request for comment. A similar suit was filed against Tesla on Thursday by the parents of Krysta Tsukahara, another victim of the crash. Tsukahara, 19, and Nelson, 20, were traveling in the back of the Cybertruck on 27 November 2024, with one other passenger and the driver. The car smashed into a tree at high speed and caught on fire, according to a California highway patrol report. When power to the truck’s electric doors was shuttered by the fire, the passengers were locked inside with no way out. The driver also died. The fourth passenger was pulled from the car after a rescuer broke a window. “The four young people in the Cybertruck were close friends and outstanding individuals, each on the verge of making meaningful contributions to the world,” Todd and Stannye Nelson, Jack’s parents, said in a statement. “They were all victims of Tesla’s unsafe design. Their deaths and injuries have devastated everyone who knew them.” The new legal threats to Tesla come just weeks after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into the car maker about its electric door handles, which are built to be flush with the body of the vehicle. The agency is also looking into complaints by drivers that said after exiting their cars, they could not open back doors to get their children out and, in some cases, had to break the window to reach them. Tesla door handles have been at the center of several other crash lawsuits because the battery powering the unlocking mechanism can be destroyed in a fire and the manual releases that override that system are difficult to find. “The backup mechanical release for that door was concealed beneath the liner of the map pocket at the bottom of the door – hidden, unlabeled, and impractical to locate or use in the smoke and chaos of a post-crash fire,” said the Nelsons. “As a result, the Cybertruck’s design left Jack and the other occupants with no practical way to escape.” The Cybertruck lawsuits follow several others that have claimed various safety problems with Tesla cars. In August, a Florida jury decided that Tesla must pay $243m in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who was killed by one of its vehicles operating in Autopilot mode.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Tesla"}

The incident involved four passengers who were in the vehicle when it hit a tree and caught on fire in a quiet Bay Area town in California, according to court documents. Only one of the crash victims survived. The suit, filed Thursday in Alameda county superior court, is being brought by the family of Krysta Tsukahara, a 19-year-old college student who was visiting her family over Thanksgiving weekend in Piedmont, California, when the crash occurred. The incident happened on the night of 27 November 2024, when the Cybertruck was traveling at high speed, struck a tree and ignited, according to a California highway patrol report. When power to the truck’s electric doors was shut down by the fire, the four passengers were locked inside with no way out. The lawsuit alleges the design of the Cybertruck’s door handles is at fault for Tsukahara’s death. From the inside of the truck, when electricity is cut off, the only way to exit a rear door is by pulling a cable that’s underneath a pocket liner under the door’s storage compartment, according to a report by Bloomberg. From outside the vehicle, the doors also remain locked and the flush handles make it difficult for rescue workers to jimmy their way inside. Tesla did not return request for comment. “The design of this vehicle failed Krysta,” said Roger Dreyer, the attorney representing the Tsukahara family. “There was no functioning, accessible manual override or emergency release for her to escape.” Tesla’s door handles are a flagship design for the vehicles and a point of pride for company CEO, Elon Musk. Teslas were the first make of car to be customized with such electric handles and are built to be flush with the body of the car to give the vehicles a more sleek and streamlined look. But the design has invited scrutiny from car-safety experts and currently is under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “Tesla had repeated and direct notice that its reliance on electronic door systems created a serious risk of entrapment,” reads the suit. “Owners, bystanders, and first responders documented instances where Tesla occupants survived crash forces but could not escape when electrical power failed and fire ensued.” The Cybertruck has received high safety ratings in crash tests, but the vehicle has also received eight recalls since it first debuted less than two years ago. Tesla has been embroiled in other lawsuits over vehicle safety, including one in Florida where a jury ruled in August that Tesla must pay $243m in damages over its driver assistance system, known as Autopilot. Tsukahara’s family is also suing the estate of the driver, Soren Dixon, who at the time of the incident was under the influence of alcohol, cocaine and amphetamines, according to a coroner’s report from Alameda county. Dixon also died in the crash. On the night of the accident, a friend was following the Cybertruck in another vehicle and saw what happened, according to various news reports. He rushed to try to save his friends, breaking a window on the Cybertruck. He was able to save one passenger, but when he attempted to rescue Tsukahara she wasn’t able to make it through the fire. The lawsuit filed on Thursday alleges that Tsukahara didn’t suffer physical trauma from the Cybertruck’s collision with the tree, but rather she died of smoke inhalation and burns because she wasn’t able to escape the vehicle. “Her death was preventable,” Tsukahara’s parents, Carl and Noelle Tsukahara, said in a statement. “She was alive after the crash. She called out for help. And she couldn’t get out.”", "section": "US news", "query": "Tesla"}

The US electric car manufacturer run by the world’s richest man has formally applied to the energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, for an electricity supply licence, according to a notice published on the watchdog’s website. This would enable Tesla, which also runs an energy supply business in the US, to provide electricity to domestic and business premises in England, Scotland and Wales as soon as next year. It can take Ofgem up to nine months to assess an application. The business is expected to be branded Tesla Electric and could focus on supplying electricity to consumers who own Tesla products such as cars or batteries. However, it would not work for households on dual-fuel contracts because the company is only applying for an electricity licence. Tesla Energy Ventures, the company’s Manchester-based energy subsidiary, made the application last month, and the move was first reported by the Sunday Telegraph. The application was signed by Andrew Payne, who has worked for Tesla since 2016 and runs the company’s energy business in Europe, with responsibility for a team of 60-plus. The move comes at a time when Tesla’s electric car sales across Europe have been falling. Sales of Teslas in the UK more than halved last month, according to data from the main industry body. Only 987 new Teslas were registered in the UK in July – down almost 60% on the 2,462 registered in July 2024. This means Tesla’s UK market share shrank to 0.7% in July, from 1.67% a year ago. For 2025 to date, Tesla sales in the UK were 7% lower. This is a period during which Musk has faced heavy criticism for his relationship with Donald Trump, which has now soured, and his interference in politics in Germany, France and the UK. Tesla has sold many home storage batteries called Powerwalls that can be charged by solar power or from the grid at off-peak times to UK households. It also sells home chargers for electric cars. The company effectively revealed its aim to sell electricity to homes two years ago when it posted a job listing looking for a head of operations. It took its first step into the British energy market in 2020 when it was granted a licence to be an electricity generator. Tesla already has an electricity supplier in Texas, where it launched household supply deals in 2022. It allows Tesla owners to charge their cars cheaply and pays them for selling surplus solar power or electricity stored in its home batteries back to the grid.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Tesla"}

Paul Hyon Kim, 36, who is in custody at the Clark county detention center, faces multiple felony counts, including suspicion of arson and destroying or injuring real or personal property, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The incident in Las Vegas was part of a wave of high-profile attacks on Tesla dealerships amid growing frustration over Elon Musk’s powerful role in the Trump administration and efforts to gut the US government. There have been large peaceful protests outside Tesla dealerships and a boycott campaign as well as growing incidents of vandalism. The Guardian has documented multiple incidents involving molotov cocktails as well as swastikas drawn with spray paint at Tesla facilities across the US and bullets fired through a dealership window. Almost 20 Tesla showrooms and charging stations have faced deliberate fires, the Guardian previously reported. Earlier this month, the Tesla site in Las Vegas was subjected to what the sheriff described as a “targeted attack”. In the early morning hours, a person dressed in black threw what looked like molotov cocktails into vehicles, security cameras showed. The suspect also fired rounds of ammunition into the parked vehicles. “Upon arrival, officers discovered several vehicles on fire, as well as the word ‘resist’ spraypainted on the front doors of the business,” Dori Koren, the assistant sheriff with the Las Vegas metropolitan police department, said at a press conference earlier this month. “At least five Tesla vehicles were damaged, to include at least two of which were engulfed in flames.” The Las Vegas police department and the FBI announced they were investigating the incident as potential terrorism, while the federal agency was looking at other incidents of molotov cocktails thrown at Tesla facilities in recent months. Musk also described the incident as “terrorism”. Donald Trump has said he would label attacks on Tesla properties as terrorism, and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, last week announced charges against three people accused of “violent destruction of Tesla properties”. Earlier this week, the FBI said it was creating a taskforce in response to the growing reports of vandalism at Tesla dealerships.", "section": "US news", "query": "Tesla"}

Hoyer said that in Woidke’s “disappointing, but predictable” answer, he denied the charge. “He said he didn’t know him personally. As if that excused him.” She had co-founded a Citizens’ Initiative to oppose Musk’s plans, announced in 2019, to build in the sparsely populated municipality in the sandy plains south-east of Berlin. The initiative’s fears at the time were largely over the potential environmental impact of the plant on the region’s pine forests and groundwater. However, more recently it is Musk’s politics that have caused particular alarm. Not only has he offered his high-profile support to far-right European parties, but at a rally after Donald Trump’s inauguration he appeared to twice make the Nazi salute. In the meantime Tesla sales have slumped, especially in Europe – where new vehicle sales fell for five consecutive months despite an overall growth in the electric car market. Heiko Baschin, another member of the citizen’s initiative, said he had been watching with a certain amount of schadenfreude. “We put our hopes in this,” the carpenter said, discussing the change in the company’s fortunes on a recent forest walk in the shadows of the sprawling Grünheide factory. As sales have declined, the factory has suffered. Shifts manufacturing the Y-Model have been reduced from three to two a day. The trade union IG Metall – which recruited several hundred workers despite opposition from Tesla – has urged the company to consider putting workers on “kurzzeit”, the short-time work allowance much of the embattled car industry has introduced to enable it to retain workers during a downturn. The regional press has reported how unsold Teslas have been moved on transporters en masse to a former East German airport 60km (37 miles) away, where, hidden behind trees and parked alongside solar panels, they bake in the sun. Musk’s apparent Nazi salute was in general met with shock and horror in Germany but did not play large in Grünheide, until campaign groups projected an image of it on to the facade of the Tesla factory, provocatively placing the Nazi-associated word “heil” in front of the Tesla logo. The shock caused by the incident was palpable on the factory floor, workers told the tabloid Berliner Kurier. “At Tesla Germany they had pretended they had nothing to do with (Musk) and were keeping quiet,” it wrote. Now they could no longer ignore their association. Workers are hard to reach, most having been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). But on Kununu, a job portal where employees can anonymously vent their feelings about their workplace, one Tesla worker has written: “The brand once stood for cosmopolitanism, progress, and tolerance, but now it stands for the exact opposite. That bothers almost everyone here, and you can feel it”. Almut, a resident of Grünheide, said local politicians were keen to cite the benefits Tesla had brought to the region, but “neglect to mention at the same time the problematic reality that we are subsidising the richest man in the world, who in no way takes any social responsibility for what happens here”. She said local people joke among themselves about what might take the place of the factory, should Tesla fail. “A munitions factory? A prison? In some ways these would seem like favourable alternatives,” she said. The only positive contribution as she saw it that Tesla had contributed to Grünheide was a robotic lawn mower it had donated to the local football club. *** Two weeks before the salute, Musk had followed his endorsement of the AfD in the German federal elections with an hour-long conversation with the anti-immigrant party’s co-leader, Alice Weidel. The two discussed topics including Hitler, solar power and German bureaucracy, which Musk said had required Tesla to submit forms running to 25,000 pages in order to build the Grünheide factory. Unmentioned was the fact that the AfD had vehemently opposed the Tesla factory, citing its fears over US-driven turbo capitalism and a watering down of workers’ rights. “People really need to get behind the AfD,” Musk said. For Grünheide’s residents who oppose Musk, their preoccupation remains the impact of the factory on their rural community, which is characterised by its woodlands, lakes and rivers. Existing cycle paths have been diverted, and new roads have required the felling of large swathes of pine forest, threatening the already perilous supplies of drinking water in a region declared a drought zone, the driest anywhere in Germany. The 300-hectare (740 acre) large factory complex itself is due to be expanded in the near future by a further 100 hectares, under plans signed off by Grünheide’s mayor despite a local referendum in which 62% expressed their opposition. Supporters point to the 11,000 jobs the factory has created, and the boost it has given to the local economy in a region of the former communist east and which was one of the lowest-performing in the country. Some young people enthuse that the trains to Berlin now run more regularly, the supermarkets are better stocked, and that their home town is now on the map as a beacon of “green capitalism” alongside Shanghai, Nevada and Austin, locations of the other Tesla factories. They hanker for an invitation to the “rave cave” techno dance space Musk has allegedly constructed within the factory complex. The recruitment page of the factory’s website – which emphasises that diversity is at the core of its business model – shows a lengthy list of positions needing to be filled, from shift managers to maintenance technicians. Nevertheless, the mood has cooled even among those who used to enthusiastically speak out in favour of Tesla, such as a group of local teenage schoolboys who habitually flew drones over the site when the factory was under construction and proudly posted the footage from them on YouTube – until Musk asked them to stop. “Nobody is willing to speak publicly about Tesla/Elon any more … even anonymously,” one told the Guardian via text message, without elaborating. There was no response to a request for an interview with the company or for access to the factory. Arne Christiani, the mayor of Grünheide and an unwavering Musk enthusiast, said he was confident Tesla would stay in Grünheide and would thrive. He was unmoved, he said, by what Musk said or did. “You have to distinguish between what happens in the US and here in Grünheide,” he said. Hoyer, who lives 9km from the factory, said she had not relinquished her dream of one day being able to see a starry sky from her garden again. “Since the factory was built the light pollution from the round-the-clock operation has put paid to that,” she said, showing before and after pictures on her mobile phone. • This article was amended on 14 July 2025.

The popularity of Tesla among liberal-minded Americans has plummeted since Musk, Tesla’s chief executive and the world’s richest person, allied himself with Donald Trump and helped propel the president to election victory last year. While liberals reported mostly positive intentions around buying an electric car in August 2023, their overall support for EVs eroded in the wake of a collapse in their opinion of Teslas, according to the new study, which polled Americans on an array of environmental actions. By the latest poll, taken in March as Musk was gutting the federal workforce in his role as Trump’s top adviser after delivering what appeared to be a Nazi salute, the intention to buy any EV among liberals slipped into negative territory. “The suspicion is that Elon Musk became so synonymous with EVs in the US that perceptions of him affected the entire class of vehicles,” said Alexandra Flores, a psychologist at Williams College and lead author of the study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications. “This made them way less appealing to liberals – he really dragged down perceptions of EVs in general. It’s definitely unusual to have a chief executive have an impact on a whole class of products like this.” Opposition to Musk over his alliance with Trump, which has since ruptured in acrimony, caused many liberal Tesla owners in the US and Europe to express embarrassment with their vehicles. Some have even adorned their cars with anti-Musk stickers that feature slogans such as “Anti Elon Tesla Club” or “I Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy.” However, the new study found that Musk’s rightwing shift has not made conservative Americans more likely to buy a Tesla or any electric car, despite separate polling showing that Republican voters now have a more favorable view of the car company than they once did. Views on Musk are also sharply divided between conservatives and liberals. Even as liberals dramatically changed their views of Tesla, and to a lesser extent EVs, most conservatives remain skeptical of both and have been consistently unwilling to consider buying an electric car in the past two years of polling. While buying an electric vehicle was the most politically polarized environmental action when the researchers’ polling began, more so than installing solar panels or even eating less red meat, Democrats and Republicans are now more in line than they were following Musk’s political foray. “We thought that liberals would be pretty stable because EVs are so historically associated with the green movement and that Musk’s rightward turn would bring conservatives on board,” said Flores. “But the opposite happened – over time conservatives remained relatively steady in their lack of interest in EVs and Tesla, while liberals’ attitudes really dropped. They are now equally unlikely to buy an EV as they are a Tesla.” Flores said that EVs’ association with climate-friendly politics may be more influential for conservatives than liberals when it comes to purchasing decisions. “The attitude among conservatives to Tesla may be slightly less negative than before but that didn’t translate into the part of psychology of how they intended to behave,” she said. “That strong link to liberalism is too much for them to be budged on. It’s more foundational to them than if they like or don’t like Elon Musk.” Musk has recently admitted that Tesla faces a “rough few quarters” ahead amid stuttering sales figures for the company in the US. Last week, Tesla announced sales for the second quarter of 2025 were 12% down on the same period last year, amid consumer concerns over tariffs, Tesla’s lineup and the imminent removal of tax credits, as well as Musk’s own image. In California, Tesla’s heartland, the situation is particularly stark, with the company posting a seventh consecutive quarter of declines in new vehicle registrations. Overall EV sales in the US dipped in the three months to July, year-on-year, and the shift to electric models is likely to be slowed further by a Republican spending bill, signed by Trump, that axes a key incentive for buyers to opt for an EV. From September, a tax credit of up to $7,500 for an electric car purchase will be deleted, with dealers expecting a rush of people to take advantage of the subsidy before it expires. “You can’t deny there are people who say they won’t buy a Tesla but the company’s numbers aren’t too surprising,” said Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive. “They have had two major products that are major sellers, they haven’t changed them in years and there is now a big influx of new and more exciting electric products out there. “I’m not sure you can attribute any falloff in EV sales to Elon, maybe him being on both sides of the coin will free EVs from being a political lightning rod,” Keating said, adding that total market share for EVs may not break 10% this year, as previously forecast. “The removal of the tax credits may slow things down, it will hurt consumers’ perception of whether they can afford an EV or not,” she said. “But EVs aren’t going away – adoption may stagnate but it won’t go off a cliff. We’ve invested too much into it and there are too many good products on the market now.” Transportation is the largest contributor to planet-heating pollution in the US and any slowdown in EV adoption would hinder attempts to address the climate crisis. “One of the more troubling implications of our study is what this means for the climate,” said Flores. “It is possible, though, that Musk’s shadow over EVs starts to fade, even if opinions about Tesla don’t recover. That pride in driving a climate-friendly vehicle may rebound among liberals.” • This article was amended on 31 July 2025.

However, on Saturday, they weren’t aimed at other drivers, for a change; instead it was Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, who was the target of their anger as part of the “Takedown Tesla” movement, which has spread from the United States. “It’s too overwhelming to do nothing,” said Louise Cobbett-Witten, who has family in the US. “There is real solace in coming together like this. Everyone has to do something. We haven’t got a big strategy besides just standing on the side of the street, holding signs and screaming.” The protest was part of a global day of protests planned under the umbrella of the Tesla Takedown movement. Organizers say the rallies will take place in front of more than 200 Tesla locations worldwide, including nearly 50 in California. Musk has not commented on the demonstrations. Cobbett-Witten has family in Washington DC, and is planning to move back to the US. The 39-year-old NHS worker, who lives in South London, said: “The checks and balances have just failed. As much as people are trying to not say these words, they are fascists, they are white supremacists, they’re xenophobes, they’re misogynists, and they’re coming for everyone. And what starts in America comes over here.” In the last fortnight, Tesla has responded to the protests outside its showroom and charging point in Park Royal by stationing a lone security guard at its gate, who said protesters had been friendly and peaceful. Dozens turned up on Saturday, their largest turnout since they began weeks ago. While Tesla sales have fallen in Europe, they rose in the UK by more than a fifth in February, according to new car-registration figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Gay-rights campaigner Nigel Warner MBE was attempting to hand out stickers to Tesla drivers entering or leaving the site in Park Royal. “This is the only thing you can do to make a difference,” the 77-year-old retired accountant from London said. “We are pretty helpless over here, the same as Europe. The only thing we can do is try to affect Tesla’s share prices and sales. It is something that has been done already with the Tesla sales dropping in many places. If he can’t sell his cars, he is finished.” Documentary film-maker Jim Green, 56, who lived in New York and Los Angeles before moving back to the UK 18 months ago, worked with Musk on a film a decade ago. Green said: “He was a different person, and he was very charismatic. He was talking when I was hanging out with him about the gigafactory where the batteries were being built, and he had a very compelling argument to make about the importance of batteries, an argument he made extraordinarily articulately. So I was very much leaning in to believing this guy wouldn’t turn into the fascist he has become.” He said Musk had attacked typical Tesla buyers, whom he described as wealthy liberals who care about the environment: “Musk has gone out of his way to insult that exact group of human beings. I lived in LA during the time when everyone who was wealthy and liberal traded their Toyota Prius in for their Tesla during 2014-2015.” Retiree Anne Kajava, 59, who is originally from Minnesota but lives in Cambridgeshire, said she was concerned about the United States’ change in policy on Europe and Ukraine. She said: “I am truly concerned about a world war three. I am concerned about a civil war within the United States. You could say those are extreme views but Trump is talking about war. You have JD Vance in Greenland; it’s not impossible.” Holding a banner attached to a Donald Trump toilet brush, she said: “I used to not hesitate to say I’m an American. Now actually I’m working with an acting coach, to fake a British accent so I can turn it on and off when I want to. I don’t want to be identified as American.”", "section": "UK news", "query": "Tesla"}

Tesla has been targeted globally by protesters furious at Musk’s work with the Trump administration, and at his ideology which the billionaire often espouses through his social media platform, X. This week that anger boiled over in the South Australian capital, half a world away from Washington DC. About 95% of the nearly 1,000 submissions were opposed to a proposal to build a Tesla showroom and battery recycling and repurposing factory. Many expressed “anti-Tesla and anti-Elon Musk sentiment”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email For decency, the local council redacted the language in some submissions to describe Musk and Tesla. “We should not support and put money in the pockets of a [redacted] who openly [redacted] salutes, is [redacted] human,” said one. The world’s richest man has announced he will leave his role in the department of government efficiency, which has slashed jobs and funding for US government agencies with often chaotic and devastating effects. He is pivoting back to his businesses, including Tesla, amid slumping sales. Meanwhile in Adelaide, the Marion city council overrode community objections and approved the factory project to proceed to the next stage, which will need state government approval. The council said the project would bring in 100 jobs and millions of dollars to the community. But the protest movement “Trees not Teslas” is determined to fight on. While conservation groups and others were protesting against the Tesla project because of the need to remove trees on the land where the plant would be built, Trees not Teslas also fired people up over Musk himself. “Neon” from Trees not Teslas did not want to use his real name, in part for fear of reprisals and in part because the group considers itself a collective. He said the traction the group got was “wild”, with their website getting thousands of views, but he acknowledged it was impossible to work out how much influence they ultimately had. Neon said the fight will continue, as the state government considers whether to approve the council’s proposal to revoke the site’s status as community land. “We just move that further up. We have to. We move that into actions for the state government,” Neon said. “We spread more awareness. We try to get more people involved. It now becomes not just a council issue but a fundamental state issue.” He said they started the campaign primarily to protect the trees on the site. “Our main focus was the trees … we’re looking to preserve green spaces,” he said. “We’re very pro-electric vehicle and pro-green energy. “But the industry that destroys green spaces is … green in name only.” The council argued that the space had not been publicly accessible since 2016 because of contamination. Neon said trees can help remediate the land. He also echoed comments made by the councillor Sarah Luscombe, who voted against the proposal, that the factory would only recycle or repurpose Tesla batteries, when most people use other brands. While the discussion has centred around electric vehicle batteries, it is possible the site could also recycle and repurpose Powerwall batteries. Guardian Australia has contacted Tesla for comment. Neon said the council voting eight to three to seek state government approval despite the community objections made the public consultation process seem like a box-ticking exercise. The mayor, Kris Hanna, said the project would bring jobs and an income stream into the community, and that Tesla would just set up elsewhere, if not in Marion. Tesla, Hanna said, had pledged to retain most significant trees and replace more trees than it was required to. Neon said the established trees would be replaced with saplings, removing many of their benefits. The state premier, Peter Malinauskas, said earlier this week that major industrial developments were welcome in the state and that while he “violently” disagreed with Musk’s politics, they were “his prerogative”. A state government spokesperson said the government welcomed investment and job creation in SA and would consider the proposal.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Tesla"}

The National Employment Savings Trust (Nest) has grown to be the largest workplace pension scheme by member numbers, with more than a third of UK employees enrolled in it . It’s 20 years ago this year since a government commission recommended creating “a low-cost, national funded pension savings scheme” into which individuals would be “automatically enrolled”. That led to Nest being set up as a publicly owned body to invest people’s pension savings. Data shared with the Guardian reveals that, to date, some Nest members have almost tripled their money once you include employer contributions and investment returns. That beats what they would have made from other savings products such as Isas. We looked at what Nest is doing with your retirement savings. What goes in Set up as a public corporation as part of the government’s automatic enrolment revolution, Nest was described at the time as “the biggest shake-up in UK pensions for over 100 years” and designed to get millions more people paying into a pension. Auto-enrolment requires all employers to automatically put eligible workers into a workplace pension where both parties pay money in. It even applies to those employing just one person, such as some people who employ a nanny, carer or gardener. The regime officially kicked off in 2012 and affects everyone in work aged between 22 and the state pension age who earns more than £10,000 a year and does not already have a suitable workplace pension. Employers must choose a provider to run the scheme for them. This provider takes the money and invests it to generate returns. Big-name employers that are using, or have used, Nest to enrol at least some employees into a pension include the BBC, McDonald’s and BT. You may not be in Nest yourself, but if – for example – you have a child or grandchild who started working during the last few years, they may well have a Nest pension pot. Most members are aged 20 to 39. Other providers include The People’s Pension, now:pensions and Smart Pension – but with more than 13.7 million members, Nest is by far the biggest. The investments Do you have an iPhone? Do you shop on Amazon? Do you use Google? If you have money in Nest, your pension may be riding on the fortunes of the big US tech firms behind such products and brands. As of the end of March, the top eight shareholdings of Nest’s default “2040 retirement date fund” were: Apple; Microsoft; the US-based computer chip maker Nvidia; Amazon; Google’s parent company Alphabet; the Facebook owner Meta; the investment company Berkshire Hathaway; and the carmaker Tesla. Some members may be uneasy about how much of their money is crossing the Atlantic, in effect helping to make tech oligarchs such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg even wealthier. That said, while a sizeable chunk of people’s money is invested in global shares, Nest is increasingly moving into investments such as private assets (including private equity and infrastructure) and private credit (basically loans to businesses). In the UK, for example, it has invested in everything from windfarms, including the huge Hornsea 1 project off the east coast of England, and solar farms, including one in Reading. It has also bought into port operators such as Forth Ports, which runs Tilbury, and shopping centres such as the Dolphin in Poole, Dorset. Nest recently announced it would be helping to build thousands of new homes for rent through a link-up with other organisations. Manchester’s New Jackson neighbourhood has been named as the first site. One interesting business in Nest’s portfolio is Deep Green, which uses the heat generated by datacentres to help UK swimming pools save money and ultimately stay open by reducing their costs. Nest’s private market holdings include loans to a five-star hotel in Paris and a French cinema group, and investments in timber – for example, it part-owns a forest in Washington state in the US. The performance We asked Nest to provide performance data, plus figures for how much people who joined the scheme at the start may have in their pension funds now. It based its calculations on someone on an average annual UK full-time income of £37,000 who, since October 2012, has made pension contributions each month at the minimum level. The figures are based on them saving into Nest’s default 2040 retirement fund. The individual would have paid in £7,605, and their employer £6,172. They have received £1,901 of tax relief on top – paid into the fund – and benefited from £5,482 of investment growth. Lop off Nest’s charges – £521 in this case – and their fund is worth £20,639 (as of the end of April this year). However, the figure for someone using Nest’s “higher risk” fund – for those willing to take more risk in the hope that their pot will grow faster – is £21,011. For its ethical fund option, the figure is £19,082. Trillions of dollars were wiped from global stock markets in early April after Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs, but markets later rallied, and the good news is that those three figures are all slightly higher than they were at the end of March. Nest’s 2040 retirement fund has delivered a total cumulative return of 199% up to the end of April 2025, assuming someone signed up on day one, while the higher risk fund delivered 236%, and the ethical fund 208%. A typical global investment fund has delivered a return of about 212% over the same period, while a typical Europe (including the UK) fund has delivered 188%, according to the data provider Morningstar Direct. The ‘small pots’ problem While Nest has more than 13 million members, the most recent data showed that more than 9 million of them were “non-contributing” members who were not topping up their pots. Many are people who started a job and were put into the Nest scheme, but then quit that job for another one, leaving their pot behind. A very rough calculation suggests the average Nest pension pot size is perhaps a little more than £3,800. That disguises a wide range of values: while some pots will be sizeable, others will have perhaps just a few hundred pounds in them. If you are unsure whether or not you have money held in Nest, check your paperwork – it will have sent you a welcome pack shortly after your employer put you into the scheme. Nest has a page on its website on identifying your pension pots. You can also call its member help centre on 0300 0200 393, which should be able to help locate your Nest account, if you have one. If you do, you can view it by logging into your online account – you will need to provide your national insurance number when you do so for the first time.", "section": "Money", "query": "Tesla"}

Best not to look, in my view. Don’t look, don’t sell, hold your nerve on the assumption it’ll be fine in 10 years’ time, just as the markets recovered eventually and ebulliently after the 2008 crash and Covid. In the meantime, let’s console ourselves with the silver lining that Elon Musk found himself personally $22.8bn the poorer on Monday, as Tesla’s share price plummeted. Even more gratifying: unlike the overall market losses, Musk’s losses were at least in part caused by personal animus. The backlash against Musk has been growing in recent weeks, driving down Tesla sales, with the car’s dealerships and drivers becoming targets. Sheryl Crow sold hers. The actor Jason Bateman said that driving a Tesla was tantamount to rocking a Trump sticker on your bumper. And with each passing week, more protesters gather outside Tesla showrooms across the US. Meanwhile, individual owners have discovered that the cost of driving a car that once symbolised wealth and status is being called a Nazi in supermarket car parks. A nice Subaru, anyone? Tuesday Ten days after Meghan Markle’s new show, With Love, Meghan, dropped on Netflix there are still questions to answer: primarily, is her insistence on calling herself Sussex strictly in line with protocol? And, by correcting the misuse of her name, was she pass-agg bullying her episode two guest, Mindy Kaling? For my money, Kaling, who appeared on the show to cut heart-shaped sandwiches like the drippy friend in a Jane Austen novel, knew exactly what she had signed up for and no sympathy is due. But reviewing the footage, it’s clear she really did trigger her host’s irritation. “It’s so funny that you keep saying Meghan Markle,” says Meghan – it’s the “keep” in that sentence where the poison is stored – not sounding amused at all. Kaling’s face went full rictus like she’d farted in front of the queen. Opinions differ as to whether Sussex is the correct surname for Markle, as opposed to Wales, Windsor or Mountbatten, and even after the New York Times put a team on it, the proper answer remains obscure. While one royal expert said Meghan was either totally oblivious to what her actual name was or she didn’t understand it, another averred that Sussex was “totally within royal protocol”. Kaling, meanwhile, had to go on TV to “break her silence” and, not the most ringing endorsement of a grand day out, clarify that she “had a great time”. Wednesday An American woman who bothered a wombat in Australia dominates global headlines for the second day running when the Australian prime minister wades into the debate. The woman, Sam Jones, who identifies as an influencer, snatched a helpless marsupial from its mother’s arms and held it aloft for the camera for lolz. In a since deleted post on a now-private Instagram, Jones, who previously posted images of herself with animals she had slain while hunting, exclaims: “I caught a baby wombat!” There are laws against this kind of thing in Australia and with the directness we expect from that part of the world, Tony Burke, the Australian home affairs minister, said: “I can’t wait to see the back of this individual.” (By the end of the week, she had left the country). But it was the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who really rose to the occasion and, in a political moment up there with “she was the people’s princess”, addressed Jones directly to say what everyone was thinking: “Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there.” Thursday In animal news closer to home, I’m helping a friend buy kittens, and who knew that the market was so weird? My friend’s first instinct was to go through the cat charities, but none of them had new litters available. Next, she looked at the fancy breeders, where pure ragdolls and Bengals can go for £1,200 a piece. At the far end of the scale was the sketchy kitten market online, where people breed litters in their spare rooms or sell them on from illegal kitten farms. The middle path is an online animal exchange where measures are taken to verify users and buyers are warned against breeders who can’t produce the mother. Here’s the wild bit: since Covid, demand for pets in some parts of the country continues to outstrip supply and ordinary tabbies in London can go for £500 a pop and get snapped up within moments of going online – something you would avoid if you weren’t at the sharp end of your children’s relentless campaigning. On Thursday my friend brought home two eight-week-olds, a boy and a girl, tiny and perfect, and OMG I’m in love. Friday To lift the end of your week, I recommend you watch the footage of the US vice-president, JD Vance, being booed at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, a much more forceful effort than the time Mike Pence, in the same job, was booed at a 2016 production of Hamilton on Broadway. Unlike the boos for Pence, which were alleviated by counter-cheers, the boos for Vance were solid, sustained, and compounded with derisive whistling, supercharged by the fact Trump fired the Kennedy Center’s chair and replaced 13 of its trustees with his own people, and accompanied by a gratifying visual: that of extremely well-heeled seniors, the Kennedy Center’s constituency, lobbing catcalls for what looked like the first time in their lives.", "section": "UK news", "query": "Tesla"}

Investor confidence in the EU has fallen sharply after Donald Trump’s trade agreement with Brussels, amid mounting concern about the economic hit from the US president’s tariff war. The latest snapshot from the Sentix index showed that investor sentiment fell significantly at the start of the month after the deal last week between Trump and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The data provider said its weekly survey of thousands of investors in more than 20 countries showed that the pact was a “deal that dampens the mood”, with Trump and the US viewed as “winners” at the expense of the eurozone. “The result is devastating for the eurozone,” said Manfred Hübner, the managing director of the Sentix economic index. “The current situation and expectations are both declining. The wrinkles of concern in the economy are deepening again.” Switzerland, which was hit with a 39% tariff by Trump, is now indicating it might make the US a better offer. Shares on the Swiss stock market dropped this morning, as traders reacted to the prospect of high levies at the US border. Tesla’s board has approved the award of $30bn (£23bn) worth of shares to its chief executive, Elon Musk, after a US court ruled against a previous pay deal for the world’s richest person. Musk will pay $2bn to buy 96m shares in the electric carmaker at the same price as the 10-year pay package agreed in 2018, which is stuck in legal limbo awaiting a court date for an appeal. The award was based on a recommendation from a “special committee” of the board. The announcement in a financial filing was accompanied by a shareholder letter from two members of the committee, Tesla’s chair, Robyn Denholm, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. It described the award as a “good faith” payment to Musk after the previous pay deal, worth $56bn, was rescinded in 2024 by a judge in Delaware, where the company was incorporated until June that year. Shares in UK lenders surged on Monday after a favourable supreme court ruling significantly slashed the anticipated bill for companies engulfed in the car finance scandal. The specialist lender Close Brothers, which is the most exposed to the scandal, jumped as much as 27% at the start of trading, and are still up 22%. The UK’s biggest motor loan provider, Lloyds Banking Group, are now up 8%. Shares in Barclays, which no longer provides car finance but is dealing with the fallout for the remaining loans on its books, rose by 1.1%. Shares in FirstRand, one of the lenders involved in the supreme court case, jumped by 4.8%. More tariff news: the European Union will suspend its two packages of countermeasures to U.S. tariffs for six months following the deal agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump. A comission spokesperson explains: “The EU continues to work with the U.S. to finalise a Joint Statement, as agreed on 27 July. “With these objectives in mind, the Commission will take the necessary steps to suspend by 6 months the EU’s countermeasures against the US, which were due to enter into force on 7 August.” The EU had threatened to impose nearly €100bn (£87bn) worth of tariffs on US imports ranging from bourbon to Boeing aircraft in one fell swoop if a trade deal wasn’t reached…. Just in: US factory orders dropped sharply in June, after a busy May. The US Census Bureau has reported that new orders for manufactured goods fell by 4.8% in June, to $611.7bn. That follows an 8,3% jump in orders in May. The drop in June was driven by weaker demand for durable goods – items designed to last several years. Wall Street has opened higher, recovering from Friday’s losses. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 317 points, or 0.75%, in early trading to 43,906 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 share index is 1% higher. Shares fell last Friday after a surprisingly weak US jobs report, which prompted Donald Trump to fire the federal government official in charge of labor statistics a few hours later. Shares in Tesla have, as expected, jumped at the start of trading. They’re up 2.5%, to just over $310 each. Over in Zurich, Switzerland’s government says it is ready to make a “more attractive” trade offer to Donald Trump, in the hope of avoiding a 39% tariff on its exports to the US. Following a crisis meeting this morning, the Swiss cabinet says: “Switzerland enters this new phase ready to present a more attractive offer, taking U.S. concerns into account and seeking to ease the current tariff situation.” Switzerland was shocked that Trump announced a 39% tariff on its wares, which prompted the drop on the Swiss stock marked this morning. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has welcomed Tesla’s decision to hand Elon Musk almost $30bn in share options that will vest in two year’s time. Ives says it“removes an overhang on the stock” adding: “Musk remains Tesla’s big asset and this comp [compensation] issue has been a constant concern of shareholders.” Today’s $30bn share award won’t be the end of the discussions about Elon Musk’s pay. In their letter to shareholders, Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson explain that the Tesla board’s special committee will continue its work on “a longer-term CEO compensation strategy”. They intent to put this plan to a shareholder vote at Tesla’s annual meeting on 6 November. Shares in Tesla have risen by over 2% in pre-market trading – a sign that Wall Street approves of Musk’s new share package. They’ve risen by 2.3% to $309 per share, up from $302 on Friday night, which will lift the value of Musk’s 96m share package closer to $30bn. Investors may well be reassured that today’s share package will keep Musk at Tesla, as the shares will vest in two year’s time. Customer loyalty towards Tesla across America has plunged since CEO Elon Musk endorsed President Donald Trump last summer, according to data from research firm S&amp;P Global Mobility. The data shows Tesla’s customer loyalty peaked in June 2024, when 73% of Tesla-owning US households in the market for a new car bought another Tesla, Reuters reports Brand loyalty rate started to nosedive in July, the month when Musk endorsed Trump. The rate bottomed out at 49.9% last March, after Musk launched the Department of Government Efficiency in January and started firing thousands of government workers. S&amp;P analyst Tom Libby called it “unprecedented” to see the runaway leader in customer loyalty fall so quickly to industry-average levels, adding: “I’ve never seen this rapid of a decline in such a short period of time.” Tesla’s US loyalty rate has since ticked back up to 57.4% in May. But even so, this does raise the question about whether Musk really deserves $30bn of shares…. Eurostar passengers travelling and from Paris face long delays and cancellations after a power failure on the high-speed rail line north of the French capital. The cross-Channel train operator warned that trains between London and Paris and Brussels and Paris would be disrupted throughout Monday. It said trains were still running but had been rerouted via slower rail lines, adding up to two hours to departures on Monday morning. A number of afternoon services have been cancelled. The latest disruption comes during peak holiday season, on the main rail route from Britain to the continent. Eurostar said it advised passengers to postpone their journey if possible, and exchange their ticket free of charge or request a full refund. It said extra staff had been deployed in the stations to assist passengers. Just in: Tesla has awarded Elon Musk stock options worth almost $30bn, in its latest attempt to pump up the billionaire’s pay packet, and keep him at the company. Tesla had announced that is has approved an award of 96 million shares of restricted stock to CEO Musk, under its 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. At Tesla’s latest share price, $302, the shares would be worth $29bn. Musk would have to pay just $23.34 per share to get them, which would cost him around $2bn, when they vest in two year’s time. This follows the blocking off Musk’s massive, $56bn, pay packet by a Delaware judge. If the Delaware pay deal is reinstated (there’s an appeal to Delaware’s Supreme Court), these new share options will by immediately forfeited, Tesla add (a sign that it is an attempt to get Musk at least part of that offer). Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, members of the special committee of the Tesla’s board of directors, told shareholders that it was “imperative to retain and motivate our extraordinary talent, beginning with Elon”. In a letter to shareholders, they added: We would also like to stress that prior to recommending this award, we reviewed your letters, read your X posts, and considered the direct feedback we have received from many of you in order to align our recommendation with your expressed views. From those communications, we know that one of your top concerns is keeping Elon’s energies focused on Tesla. This award is a critical first step toward achieving that goal, although it is limited by the capacity of our current equity incentive plan. As such, we are also working on next steps to address that issue. Still, while our work remains ongoing, we feel it is important to communicate directly and transparently with you all, our shareholders and Tesla’s owners. The Swiss franc has weakened again this morning, adding to Friday’s losses, as traders anticipate steep tariffs on Switzerland’s goods at the US border. The euro has climbed by almost 0.5% against the swiss franc, to 0.9355CHF. Raffi Boyadjian, lead market analyst at Trading Point, says: Many investors remain hopeful that some of the steep tariffs announced last week will be renegotiated and reduced. For example, reports suggest that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will meet with Trump later this week to potentially reach a deal that would bring down the 35% levy on Canadian imports into the US. The Canadian dollar is unchanged versus the greenback today, but the Swiss franc is tumbling following the White House’s decision to slap 39% tariffs on Switzerland – something not expected by the Swiss government. The yen, meanwhile, enjoyed a revival in its safe-haven status during Friday’s risk-off trading, although it is paring those gains today, with the dollar rebounding to just below 148 yen. Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Vontobel, has warned that 39% tariffs on Swiss exports to the US would be “devastating for numerous brands in Switzerland.” Investor sentiment in the euro zone has taken a tumble, as the EU-US trade deal annnounced a week ago dampened confidence. Data provider Sentix’s latest confidence gauge found that investors are not impressed by the EU’s latest tariff deal with the US. The survey of 1,050 investors, conducted from July 31 to August 2, found a decline in the current economic situation, and also in future expectations. It also found a slump in confidence about the Swiss economy, after Donald Trump announced Switzerland will face a 39% tariff – much higher than the EU’s 15%. Sentix reports: The latest data from the “first mover” provides investors’ initial assessment of the EU-US tariff deal. And the result is devastating for the eurozone. The sentix economic index has fallen significantly to -3.7 points. The current situation and expectations are both declining. The wrinkles of concern in the economy are deepening again. Even German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who recently raved about a turnaround in the economy, has been proven wrong: the Germany index has collapsed by more than 12 points to -12.8 points. Donald Trump and the US are the winners in the current figures. Advance effects are the main factor pumping up the situation figures. However, expectations are also falling in the US to -7.8 points. Investors are particularly harsh on the Swiss economy. The sentix economic index has slumped by a full 21.2 points here. Sentix managing director Manfred Huebner says: “The tariff agreement is proving to be a real mood killer.” Swatch group chief executive Nick Hayek has called on Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington to negotiate a better deal than the 39% tariffs announced on Swiss imports into the United States. Hayek told Reuters on Monday he was confident an agreement could still be reached before the tariffs, which were announced on Friday, went into effect on August 7. Hayek said: “Karin Keller-Sutter is the boss of the Swiss government, she is the president. She should take the plane and go to Washington. That would increase the chances of a deal enormously. “It’s not doomsday. Of course a settlement can be reached. Why would Donald Trump say tariffs are coming on August 1 and not implement them until the 7th? The door is always open.” The Swiss stock market has tumbled into the red after Donald Trump shocked Switzerland by announcing a 39% tariff on its imports to the US. The Swiss Main Index (SMI) is down over 1%, after losing almost 2% at the start of trading. The market had been closed on Friday for a public holiday, so this is Zürich traders’ first opportunity to react. Most stocks are in the red, including pharmaceuticals firm Roche (-1%), luxury goods maker Richemont (-0.8%), and bank UBS (-1.8%). Economists have warned that the tariffs would have a serious impact on the export-oriented Swiss economy, increasing the risk of recession. South Africa’s FirstRand has said it may need to update its accounting provisions after Friday’s supreme court ruling on motor finance claims, potentially pushing the lender’s annual earnings growth towards the lower end of its forecast. It told shareholders: On 11 December 2024, FirstRand Bank London Branch obtained permission from the Supreme Court to appeal the UK Court of Appeal’s judgment against it in respect of the Wrench and Johnson motor finance commissions cases. The appeal was heard by the Supreme Court between 1 April 2025 and 3 April 2025. FirstRand welcomes the clarity provided by the judgment. FirstRand Bank London Branch’s main ground of appeal (that car dealers do not owe their customers a fiduciary duty) was upheld, and it is important to note that the successful ground was the most important and substantive issue that required the Supreme Court’s consideration following last year’s UK Court of Appeal ruling. The company had earlier expected to deliver full-year earnings growth in the low double-digit to mid-teens range, Reuters reports. Shares in FirstRand are up 4.7% this morning, on the Johannesburg stock exchange. The trade body for the motor finance sector has criticised the Financial Conduct Authority for proposing to backdate its compensation scheme to 2007. Stephen Haddrill, director general of the Finance &amp; Leasing Association, told Radio 4’s Today programme that while it “makes sense” to have a compensation schem, there rae “major concerns” about the time limit. Haddrill argued: I just think it’s completely impractical. It’s not simply firms that don’t have the details about contracts back then, customers don’t either. The head of the UK’s financial watchdog is urging consumers seeking redress in the car finance scandal not to use claims management companies or law firms to handle their case. Nikhil Rathi, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, has told Radio 4’s Today Programme that the FCA’s proposed compensation scheme will be free to use. Rathi says: “We have taken action against 225 adverts because there have been exaggerated claims out there. If you sign up to these companies you may lose up to 30% of any money you are owed. He also explains that the FCA will now have to decide which car finance commissions should be classed as ‘unfair’ – based on the guidance from the supreme court. Rathi explains: They [the court] have said that different characteristics determine what is unfair. It could be the level of the commission, how it was disclosed, the characteristics of a consumer…. Rathi also explains that the FCA could start its compensation scheme by October, and hopes that compensation can start to be paid out next year. The regulator is looking to the industry to cooperate over this, he adds. Shares in Barclays are up over 1.8% in early trading. It had previously set aside £90m to cover potential motor finance compensation payouts. Boom! Shares in lenders exposed to the UK car finance scandal have surged at the start of trading in London, as investors react to Friday night’s supreme court ruling. Shares in Close Brothers jumped 27% after the stock market opened, after the court ruled in its favour in a case over car finance. Close Bros are leading the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies. Lloyds Banking Group is leading the larger FTSE 100 share index – its shares have jumped by almost 6% in early trading. As flagged earlier, Lloyds had previously set aside £1.2bn to cover compensation claims over car finance commissions paid to car dealers. These share price moves are a clear sign that the Supreme court ruling is a win for the lenders, even though the FCA is now consulting on a compensation scheme for motorists. That’s because the FCA estimates the cost of its scheme will be between £9bn and £18bn. Before the supreme court overturned two of the three rulings against the industry, lenders were facing an estimated bill of £44bn. The announcement of BP’s major oil discovery comes a day after energy producers agreed to boost output again. The Opec+ group agreed on Sunday to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated hikes designed to regain market share. The move means Opec+ has now fully reversed its largest tranche of output cuts, made as oil demand slumped after the Covid-19 pandemic. The oil price is little changed this morning, though, with Brent crude up 0.25% at $69.83 per barrel. Away from the car finance scandal, BP has made its biggest largest oil discovery in 25 years, off the coast of Brazil. BP has told the City that it has made a significant oil and gas discovery at the Bumerangue prospect in the deepwater offshore Brazil. BP says it made the discovery after drilling an exploration well in the Santos Basin, 404 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro. The site has a water depth of 2,372 metres, and the well was drilled to a total depth of 5,855 metres. It discovered a hydrocarbon column with an estimated depth of 500 metres, in a “pre-salt carbonate reservoir” with an area more than 300 square kilometres. Gordon Birrell, BP’s executive vice president for Production &amp; Operations says: “We are excited to announce this significant discovery at Bumerangue, bp’s largest in 25 years. This is another success in what has been an exceptional year so far for our exploration team, underscoring our commitment to growing our upstream. Brazil is an important country for bp, and our ambition is to explore the potential of establishing a material and advantaged production hub in the country.” The FCA’s decision to consult on an industry-wide compensation scheme for car finance customers could have “significant ramifications” for the UK motor finance industry, says Hyder Jumabhoy, partner at international law firm White &amp; Case. Jumabhoy explains: “While it is too early to predict the full impact with certainty until the FCA’s consultation process is complete, we expect this move to accelerate M&amp;A activity due to some lenders having decreased risk appetite but also because of unused provision amounts becoming available for acquisitions. It could also prompt some car manufacturers to enter the UK motor finance market to steady the supply of finance to buyers of new vehicles. “The next six weeks in the run-up to the launch of the FCA’s consultation will be crucial, as the industry assess the implications of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the emerging shape of the scheme in 2026.” Specialist financier S &amp; U PLC has welcomed last week’s Supreme Court decisions on motor finance commissions as a “victory for common sense”. Anthony Coombs, Chairman of S&amp;U, argues the ruling will significantly boost confidence throughout the motor finance industry and benefit lenders and consumers alike in attracting investment and increasing competition. In a statement to the City this morning, Coombs added: As such, it is entirely consistent with the Treasury’s recent emphasis on regulation which encourages growth and which will, in the words of the Financial Conduct Authority, “ensure the integrity of the motor finance market, so that it works well for future consumers.” S &amp; U are the parent company of Advantage Finance, which they say has never used the discretionary commission arrangements which are at the heart of the car finance scandal. Close Brothers, who have been one of the UK’s biggest providers of car loans, has issued a short statement to the City this morning. The firm says: Further to the group’s announcement issued on 2 August, we note the announcement of the Financial Conduct Authority on 3 August of its intention to consult on an industry wide redress scheme in respect of motor finance commissions. We look forward to engaging with the FCA in respect of the consultation. On 2 August, Close Brothers said it “welcomes the outcome” of the supreme court ruling, adding that it “provides clarity on important legal and commercial principles.” Back in March, the company posted a £103m loss for the first half of its financial year, and estimated that the motor finance commission scandal would cost it a total of £200m this year. Lenders exposed to the car finance scandal are issuing statements this morning, ahead of the opening of the London stock exchange at 8am. Lloyds Banking Group says it has undertaken an initial assessment of the impact of Friday’s supreme court judgment. Lloyds, which had previously set aside £1.2bn to cover compensation payments, has told the City that “whilst the judgment announced on 1 August provides additional clarity, there remain a number of uncertainties that the Group continues to consider in its approach to provisioning.” The bank says: After initial assessment of the Supreme Court judgment, and pending resolution of the outstanding uncertainties, in particular the FCA redress scheme, the Group currently believes that if there is any change to the provision it is unlikely to be material in the context of the Group. The provision will continue to be reviewed for any further information that becomes available, with an update provided as and when necessary. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The latest twists in the UK car finance scandal could grip the City today, as investors try to estimate where the financial impact will land, and how heavy it will be. Yesterday afternoon, Britain’s financial regulator said it would open a redress scheme for consumers who were treated unfairly when they bought a vehicle using car finance, and “secret” commission payment were made to car dealers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will consult on the redress scheme, which could cost banks between £9bn and £18bn. Motorists who were mis-sold car finance were warned that they are likely to get less than £950 a claim. Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said last night: “It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It’s fair for their customers to be compensated. We also want to ensure that the market, relied on by millions each year, can continue to work well and consumers can get a fair deal.” “Our aim is a compensation scheme that’s fair and easy to participate in, so there’s no need to use a claims management company or law firm. If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.” “It will take time to establish a scheme but we hope to start getting people any money they are owed next year.” The FCA is acting after the UK supreme court partly overturned a landmark Court of Appeal case on hidden car finance commission claims on Friday, a move that looks like a partial win for lenders. The court rejected two claims which alleged that commissions paid to car dealers were bribes, and that dealers owed a duty of loyalty to the customer. As my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff explains here, the court appears to have closed the door to compensation except in more serious cases, although they did uphold a third case of a customer, Marcus Johnson, concluding that he had been treated unfairly. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has told Sky News the consultation is “likely to mean 40% of people who got a car finance deal between 2007 and 2021 will be due some form of redress, likely to be hundreds not thousands of pounds”. The Supreme Court ruling came just after the London stock market close on Friday night. The market reopens at 8am, so we’ll see how the City reacts to the verdict, and the FCA’s compensation scheme, shortly… The agenda 3pm BST: US factory orders report for June", "section": "Business", "query": "Tesla"}

Tesla sold 2,016 vehicles in the UK in May, down from 3,152 in May 2024 – a 36% drop, according to the monthly snapshot from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The Chinese carmaker BYD’s sales in the UK jumped by 407%, from 596 in May last year to 3,025 last month. It sells hybrids as well as pure electric cars. BYD first overtook Tesla in January. Tesla has sold 15,002 cars in the UK so far this year, down 7.8% from 16,272 in the same period last year. Tesla sales have fallen in some of its biggest markets this year and there have been political protests at some of its showrooms. It is also coming up against fierce competition from rivals including BYD. New car sales overall in the UK increased by 1.6% last month to 150,070 vehicles. It was the best May performance since 2021 but still 18.3% lower than before the Covid pandemic in 2019, and only the second month of growth this year, reflecting brittle consumer confidence and economic turbulence, the SMMT said. Demand was driven by corporate fleets and other businesses, responsible for almost two-thirds of car registrations, while interest from private buyers fell for the second consecutive month, down by 2.3%. There were double-digit declines in deliveries of petrol and diesel cars, down by 12.5% and 15.5%, while demand for the latest electric models increased dramatically to take a combined 47.3% market share. Uptake of hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) grew by 6.8% to 20,351 cars, while plug-in hybrid EVs rose by nearly 51% to 17,898. Registrations of battery EVs increased by more than a quarter, accounting for 21.8% of the market, as car manufacturers sought to entice buyers with incentives. Colin Walker, the head of transport at the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the UK’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate – a set of government regulations designed to boost the number of EVs on the road – “continues to do its thing, increasing competition between manufacturers, driving down prices and driving up sales”. In terms of EV sales in the UK so far this year, Tesla is on the verge of losing its number one spot to Volkswagen, which has increased its EV sales by 201%, Walker said, citing analysis by the thinktank New AutoMotive. Other manufacturers, such as Ford, Renault and Peugeot, have also posted big increases as they switch to electric cars. BYD, the only Chinese manufacturer in the top 10, has achieved 261% growth. James Hosking, the managing director of the secondhand car website AA Cars, said EV sales were increasing as more consumers recognised the long-term running-cost savings and environmental benefits, but added: “While manufacturer incentives and falling secondhand EV prices are helping, concerns about charging access and range anxiety continue to hold some buyers back.”", "section": "Technology", "query": "Tesla"}

But Tesla, one of the world’s biggest corporate names, does not have a conventional chief executive. After Elon Musk backed Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – calling the party Germany’s “only hope” – voters are considering an alternative to Tesla. Data released on Thursday showed that registrations of the company’s electric cars in Germany fell 76% to 1,429 last month. Overall, electric vehicle registrations rose by 31%. Tesla’s biggest shareholder, who has voiced support for rightwing leaders around the world, is now a de facto US cabinet member under Donald Trump’s administration. Tesla’s valuation has become inextricably tied to Musk’s politics. After he spent $288m backing Trump’s 2024 election victory, Tesla’s valuation passed $1tn. Yet Musk’s political involvements – unprecedented for the head of a company that size – could also be having a negative effect. On Friday, a group of Extinction Rebellion activists occupied a Tesla store in central Milan. Activists chained themselves to the cars’ tyres, and others glued themselves to the windows along with the slogans “Make millionaires pay again” and “Ecology for all, no ecofascism”. Analysts are openly wondering if Musk is causing lasting damage to a brand he has made synonymous with electric cars and, by extension, liberal aspirations to tackle climate change. Tesla was approached for comment. Tesla was the world’s biggest producer of battery electric cars in 2024, but sales dropped to 1.79m, the first time the company has endured a sales decline since 2011 after years of rapid growth that made it the world’s most valuable carmaker. The manufacturer said in January that global sales would grow during 2025, and Wall Street analysts expect Tesla to sell more than 2m cars this year. But even those forecasts would hardly represent a blazing return to form. As recently as October, Musk said he expected 20% to 30% annual sales growth, implying as many as 2.3m cars sold. “Customer retention will be key in 2025 as customers may begin to look for an ‘Alternative for Tesla’,” said Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based electric car analyst. Other analysts are more optimistic. Dan Ives, of Wedbush Securities, a US financial firm, is a longstanding Tesla supporter. Ives believes the company’s share price could rise from its current level of about $280 to hit $550. However, he acknowledged the negative perception created by Musk’s partnership with Trump and his work on the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) – an issue he described as the “elephant in the room” for the brand. Calling them “major brand worries for Tesla”, he added in a note to investors that the direct impact on sales should be relatively small. “We estimate less than 5% of Tesla sales globally are at risk from these issues despite the global draconian narrative for Musk.” Ives said that Tesla was on the verge of making a new, cheaper vehicle – costing less than $35,000 – and would “own” the autonomous vehicle market, factors that would help push Tesla to a valuation of more than $2tn. Nonetheless there are clear signs in the US, Tesla’s biggest market, that would-be buyers are wavering, according to Strategic Vision, a market research company. Its new vehicle experience study tracks the buying preferences of up to 250,000 car buyers in the US, and it shows a sharp decline in regard for Tesla since Musk bought Twitter (now X) in 2022. Shortly before the multibillionaire bought the social media platform, 22% of new vehicle buyers would have “definitely” considered buying a Tesla. By the end of 2024 it was just under 8%. The proportion who would not consider buying a Tesla has risen from 39% over the same period to 63%. According to Strategic Vision, approximately half of non-Tesla EV buyers identify as Democrat or liberal, compared with about 20% identifying as Republican or conservative. Among Tesla owners, the Democrat owner group has fallen from 40% during the Biden administration to 29% now, with the Republican group averaging about 30% since 2021. “Democrats, the majority party of EV owners, are now actively rejecting Tesla and choosing other options,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision. Meanwhile, global protests against Musk and Tesla are intensifying. In America, there have been demonstrations outside dozens of Tesla showrooms, while in the UK a guerrilla poster campaign – “0 to 1939 in 3 seconds” – has emphasised Musk’s fascist-style salute at an inauguration rally. In Germany, he was recently caricatured on a carnival float as “Napo-Elon”. Ross Gerber, chief executive of the US investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki, which holds shares in Tesla, said Musk had given people an outlet to express their disdain for his politics. He said: “He has left himself open to a direct way for people to attack him if they don’t like his politics. It’s ironic because the vehicles were made for liberals who care about the environment and it has become a symbol of the conservative movement.” Tesla is valued at about $847bn – still more than the next 10 carmakers combined. Few investment banks have included any effect from Musk in their work trying to accurately value Tesla. Still, there are further reports of falling sales. In Australia, February sales were down about 72% compared with the same month in 2024, according to data released this week. Several analysts have raised concerns that the current valuation is much too high. JP Morgan is among the most pessimistic of the investment banks, suggesting that Tesla’s share price could fall as low as $135 – or a valuation closer to $400bn. Musk is the largest shareholder in Tesla, a key contributor to his status as the world’s wealthiest person. “Tesla shares continue to strike us as having become completely divorced from the fundamentals,” wrote JP Morgan in January, pointing out that 2025 profit expectations were down 70% since 2022. The share price has more than doubled since then – something that would not usually happen when investors expect lower profits. Analysts at UBS, a Swiss investment bank, concur, saying that Tesla’s valuation “continues to confound us”, with big risks in its efforts to make money from self-driving cars or humanoid robots. While sales declined steeply in January in several markets, several analysts have warned against relying on numbers for a single month. Schmidt said: “Some consumers are likely holding back purchase decisions and waiting for the updated Model Y which arrives this month. The big question though is, are these just the die-hard Tesla enthusiasts which remain in line while other potential consumers jump ship?” There have also been positive signs elsewhere. UK Tesla sales fell in January, but bounced back by a fifth in February to leave sales up year-on-year for 2025 so far. In the US there were also signs of a recovery after a fall in January, with preliminary data for February indicating rebound sales of about 42,000 cars, up 14% year-on-year, according to Wards Intelligence. But the UK sales figures also highlight another concern for investors: that Tesla’s lead on rivals could be narrowing as a flood of new models arrive. Tesla’s electric market share for the first two months of 2025 was 11%, down from 14% in 2024, according to New Automotive, a research group. Ben Nelmes, New Automotive’s chief executive, said: “The impact of Elon Musk’s political views on Tesla’s sales may have been overstated, but Tesla is gradually losing its position as the dominant EV seller in the UK as other carmakers bring more up-to-date and cheaper models to market.” In China Tesla is under big pressure from a slew of cheaper competitors, most notably BYD. In Tesla’s second-biggest market, sales of its China-made EVs dropped 49% year-on-year in February, to the lowest level since August 2022. Edward Niedermeyer, author of Ludicrous – a 2019 book about Tesla which focuses on Musk’s habit of making bold claims about the business that don’t stack up – argues that the prospect for new business like robotaxis and robots are distant. “The unique moment that we’re in now is the business has peaked,” he said. The worry for Tesla investors is whether Musk has turned that peak into a cliff-edge. Additional reporting Lorenzo Tondo", "section": "Technology", "query": "Tesla"}
