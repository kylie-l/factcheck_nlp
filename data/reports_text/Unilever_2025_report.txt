1 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 Climate Policy Engagement Review Unilever Climate Policy Engagement Review Progress update 2025 1 2 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 Unilever believes that transitioning to become a net zero business has many benefits.
It improves efficiency, increases resilience, and future-proofs our value chain against risks, while sparking new technologies and helping attract great people.
Investments in sustainability initiatives are increasingly seen as delivering higher returns and driving value within businesses.
Climate change is a principal risk to Unilever’s success.
It has the potential – to varying degrees – to negatively impact our business in the short, medium, and long term.
The best way to mitigate this risk is to actively engage in and support actions that limit global warming to no more than 1.5°C, as per the Paris Agreement.
This is a goal that remains achievable in the long term even though the pathway to this is narrowing dangerously.
To have real impact, these actions must be consistent and emanate from all parts of our value chain.
Industry bodies and trade associations are powerful actors in our value chain.
They often serve as the voice of business when governments and regulatory bodies draft laws that can either undermine or keep alive a 1.5°C future.
That’s why it is important that advocacy undertaken by our trade associations aligns with our own advocacy.
We lobby in favour of a policy and regulatory landscape that will enable us to deliver our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) and support Unilever’s growth plans.
The CTAP sets out our updated near-term emissions reduction targets – approved in 2024 by the Science Based Targets initiative – as well as the policies we believe we need to deliver them.
While our CTAP outlines our own plans and policy positions, this update to last year’s Climate Policy Engagement Review (CPER) scrutinises the positions and engagement of our key industry bodies and trade associations, during 2024, to see how well aligned they are with our climate positions.
This update helps us identify both commendable practices and areas for improvement, with a view to informing actions that Unilever and other businesses could take to address areas of misalignment, or indeed identifying opportunities to increase constructive engagement.
In this update, we also include an outline of Unilever’s direct activities.
We remain committed to scaling up climate solutions and using all the channels available to us – including both our direct and indirect engagement with policymakers – to drive down emissions across our value chain and beyond.

At the time, 13 of the 27 associations were found to have taken positions during that twoyear period that were at least partially misaligned with Unilever’s climate policy positions (see CTAP1 or page 6 of this document) and/or science-based policy,2 with one other assessed as unclear due to insufficient information.

Reduced resistance to Paris-aligned climate policies Overall, of the 26 associations assessed, 18 have no instances of misalignment with Unilever’s climate policy positions or science-based policy during the review period – up from 13 out of 27 last year.
Seven associations were found to have shifted from previously obstructive or misaligned stances on a specific policy issue to more inactive or neutral positions during 2024, compared with just one instance of an association moving in the opposite direction.
4 1 Unilever Climate Transition Action Plan updated 2024 2 Unilever advocates and lobbies for policies that advance the goal of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5°C, per the Paris Agreement, and help us deliver our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP).
3 The German Chemical Industry Association (VCI) has been excluded in this update on the basis that Unilever is not a direct member, and we have communicated to VCI that they do not have permission to use Unilever’s logo or in any way imply that Unilever endorses VCI’s policy positions.
4 Evidence of associations’ engagement activities was gathered and assessed during October and November 2024, and any activities since the previous assessment – carried out 12 months earlier – were included in scope.
Technically, this update covers the period from October/November 2023 to October/November 2024.
However, it is important to note that this may not always indicate an actual shift in the association’s stance.
Associations might have been inactive on an issue during 2024 simply because it hasn’t been on the legislative or regulatory agenda in their jurisdiction.
Nonetheless, inaction is better than obstruction and we intend to work with these associations to move them, where possible, from inactive or neutral to constructive.
Trade associations with no misalignment 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2023 2024 18 of 26 associations have no misalignment with Unilever or science-based policy (8 are misaligned) 13 of 27 have no misalignment (14 are misaligned) No Misalignment Misalignment 2.
Opportunities to move engagement from passive to constructive remain a key focus 13 of the 26 associations assessed can be classified as passively aligned.
This means that, while an association’s public position on climate policy aligns with our positions and Parisaligned science-based benchmarks, its actual engagement is either minimal or non-existent.
Meanwhile, just five associations are assessed as fully aligned and actively engaged (up from three in 2023).
It is encouraging that more associations align with our climate policies compared with the previous year.
However, active support for the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement remains a concern.
After last year’s CPER, Unilever outlined additional actions for trade associations to take.
Many were responsive to requests, but more work is needed to make sure these actions lead to policy changes, especially since the last review was recent.
There is an opportunity for Unilever to work with fellow trade association members to improve engagement on key business climate priorities in a coordinated way.
To meet Unilever’s CTAP goals, limit climate change damage, and boost economic growth through decarbonisation, our associations must demonstrate strong engagement in supporting science-based climate policies.
There have been some notable exceptions to the findings around passive engagement.
• Climate ambition/NDCs: two associations were found to have actively pushed for governments to submit more ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC (CLG, WBCSD).
• Carbon pricing: two associations were found to have engaged constructively on the issue of carbon pricing during 2024 (CBI, WBCSD).
• Regenerative agriculture: three associations were assessed as ‘constructive’ on policies to promote regenerative agriculture (FDE, SFPA, WBCSD).
UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 5 8 6 • • Deforestation-free: Fossil fuel phase-out: • Non-fossil chemical feedstocks: the same three associations were assessed as ‘constructive’ on policies to tackle deforestation (FDE, SFPA, WBCSD).
two associations were found to have actively lobbied in favour of a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels (CLG, WBCSD).
one association was found to have actively promoted policies to accelerate the scale-up of non-fossil chemical feedstocks (Cefic).
Engagement intensity of non-misaligned trade associations in 2024 20 15 10 5 0 2023 2024 Moderate Engagement No Meaningful Engagement High Engagement Low Engagement 3.
Constructive engagement on Unilever policy priorities has remained stable The industry association assessment looks in detail at how associations engaged on Unilever’s climate policy priorities.
17 associations were found to be constructively engaged on at least one Unilever priority during 2024.
Six of these were constructively engaged on two or more of our priority issues.
This is consistent with the results of our 2023 CPER.
Scaling up renewable energy capacity is the policy priority on which the most associations are constructively engaged: 16 of 26 associations are assessed as constructive on this issue – including 13 of 14 cross-industry groups.
This is to be expected since access to renewable power is an issue that affects every business in every sector.
Contradictory positions: rapid phase-out of fossil fuels versus renewable energy For the associations assessed as misaligned with Unilever and/or science-based policy, the most common area of misalignment is the need for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels versus renewable energy.
Of the seven associations found to be misaligned with Unilever on this issue, all seven also advocated for policies to increase renewable energy.
It is positive that these seven trade associations support the scale-up of renewable energy.
However, the IPCC5, IEA6 and others are clear that scaling up renewable capacity is necessary but insufficient for successful decarbonisation.
5 See specifically the IPCC’s Working Group III report on the Mitigation of Climate Change (published in 2022) which called for ‘a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use’ and warned that ‘the continued installation of unabated fossil fuel infrastructure will “lock-in” GHG emissions’.
6 https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-roadmap-a-global-pathway-to-keep-the-15-0c-goal-in-reach Phasing out fossil fuels is vital for achieving our CTAP goals, since it is a prerequisite for achieving fully decarbonised power grids.
As stated in our CPER, Unilever’s goal is to support policymakers to commit to 100% decarbonised power systems by 2035 in advanced economies, and by 2040 at the latest for others.
Except in very limited circumstances, any continued investment in expanding fossil fuel production and infrastructure is not consistent with these ambitions.
To conclude, it is encouraging to see an improvement in the number of associations with no misalignment.
However, more work is needed on constructive engagement and addressing contradictory positions on energy production.
Unilever is clear on where progress is necessary, and we continue to engage with our associations to drive systems-level change that supports a policy and regulatory environment that enables the delivery of our CTAP.
Our approach: direct climate policy engagement Priority climate policy areas In March 2024, Unilever updated its Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP).
The ultimate ambition of the CTAP is to reduce emissions consistent with the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, and to reach net zero emissions across our value chain by 2039.7 The focus of our plan is how we will meet our 2030 science-based targets and the main challenges and dependencies across our priority action areas.
We have also recognised the need for more targeted external engagement to drive systemic change, to help us meet our targets, and progress towards our long-term net zero ambition.
Detailed advocacy priorities now target specific barriers to the delivery of our CTAP and provide increased clarity on where we must work with governments, regulators, or industry to shift the systems we are part of.
These are: Cross-cutting policies 1.
Raise the ambition of national climate strategies and plans in key markets to align with a 1.5°C pathway.
Ensure carbon is priced at levels necessary for the delivery of the Paris Agreement.
Scale up renewable energy capacity and ensure the rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, including fossil fuel subsidies.
Support forest protection and nature restoration.
Encourage the evolution of the GHG Protocol standards to incentivise emissions reduction actions in value chains.
Unilever Climate Transition Action Plan updated 2024 8 7 Policies that drive the global transition to net zero and accelerate the impact of Unilever’s mitigating actions.
Importantly, by supporting policies that create a level playing field, we aim to de-risk the transition, helping us achieve our ambitions without putting the business at a competitive disadvantage.
7 8 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 Business Group specific advocacy priorities9 • Reformulating products: Ensure Standards of Identity rules are not a barrier to portfolio development.
• Forest-risk commodities: Advocate for policies that facilitate the maintenance of a deforestation-free supply chain even when sourcing increasing volumes of ingredients in a competitive market.
• Regenerative agriculture: Lobby for a regulatory landscape that supports farmers to transition to and maintain a regenerative agriculture approach.
• Chemical ingredients: Create a level playing field that supports national policies that rapidly accelerate the scale-up of non-fossil chemical feedstocks and addresses energy emissions from ingredient production.
• Packaging: Advocate for the development of well-designed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation, implementation of regulated EPR schemes, and an agreed Global Plastics Treaty.
• Logistics: Support policies that drive the clean transition of transportation infrastructure, e.g.
access to renewable energy and EV infrastructure.
• Ice-cream cabinets: Improve access to renewable energy and remove barriers to warming up the cold chain.
• Aerosols: Address potential regulatory roadblocks in Canada.
Internal oversight of climate policy engagement The management system for Unilever’s direct and indirect climate policy engagement is overseen by our Global Sustainability and Corporate Affairs function.
For direct lobbying, we adhere to the following process: • Global climate advocacy priorities are defined through an annual planning and review process.
In line with our commitment, all direct lobbying priorities are assessed to ensure consistency with our objectives in delivering the 1.5°C ambition of the Paris Agreement.
Plans are approved by the Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer.
9 Unilever has five Business Groups: Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care, Foods, and Ice-cream.
10 Unilever Code of Business Principles and Code Policies 2024 • Priorities and guidance are then given to Unilever’s Business Groups and our in-country Sustainability and Corporate Affairs teams, who apply our global objectives in a local context.
All public policy engagement that Unilever undertakes must adhere to our Code of Business Principles.10 Colleagues who engage with industry associations must also undertake mandatory compliance training.
Our policy engagement has been, and will continue to be, a key driver in helping to deliver the goals set out in our CTAP.
Our CEO and Executive Board member is ultimately responsible for overseeing our climate change agenda.
Further details on our internal governance are included in our updated CTAP.
Our approach: indirect climate policy engagement and working with industry associations Aligning industry associations to Unilever’s objectives Engaging directly is only one method a business can use to shape policy.
Unilever is affiliated with around 600 industry associations, which address a variety of issues.
Recognising the influence industry associations have on climate policy, we have consistently advocated for aligning indirect climate lobbying with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement.
• In 2019, we wrote to our associations asking them to confirm whether their policy engagement was aligned to the 1.5°C ambition of the Paris Agreement.
• In 2022, we conducted our first internal review of our industry associations to assess which topics and issues they are most engaged with on Unilever’s behalf, and which associations are most engaged on climate policy.
In 2023, we carried out more detailed analysis in the form of our first CPER,11 which we published in March 2024.
The objective was to gain deeper insights into the positions and levels of engagement of our trade associations, as well as to help Unilever encourage those associations to work with policymakers to implement policies that will deliver real emissions reductions and support growth.
As a result of this review, Unilever’s relationship managers engaged with their trade associations on key positions and expected actions.
Examples of these actions include: • In 2023, Unilever committed to working with the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) through working groups and direct engagement to further develop policies that promote the use of renewable and recycled carbon feedstocks.
Since the last review, there has been constructive engagement with Cefic on non-fossil feedstocks.
• In the 2023 CPER, both the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI) and Tennessee Chamber of Commerce & Industry (TCCI) were deemed misaligned in multiple policy areas, and we took the following actions: • Update on VCI: Unilever is an indirect member of VCI through its membership of IKW – the German Cosmetic, Toiletry, Perfumery and Detergent Association.
Unilever informed VCI and IKW that VCI is misaligned on climate ambition, renewables, and carbon pricing.
Unilever asked VCI to remove its name from its website because Unilever is not a direct member and VCI does not speak for Unilever.
• Update on TCCI: Unilever is a member of TCCI due to its ice-cream manufacturing plant in Covington, Tennessee.
Due to its current position on certain environmental issues, TCCI does not speak for Unilever on climate change.
Following the separation of our Ice-cream business, due in late 2025, there will be a review of our trade association memberships, including TCCI.
11 Unilever Climate Policy Engagement Review 9 10 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 Internal governance of industry associations Unilever reviews its membership of global industry associations on an annual basis and is committed to conducting a full review every three years.
The last review took place at the end of 2022.
Furthermore, we publish a list of our principal/main trade associations, alliances, and advocacy groups by spend across our regions.12 Our Trade Association Standard, approved by the Unilever Leadership Executive, sets out that, at the point of joining or renewing membership (typically an annual process) the Unilever relationship manager must seek confirmation from industry associations that their climate policy work is consistent with Unilever’s positions and the 1.5°C ambition of the Paris Agreement.
Addressing misalignment Where our CPER 2023 found examples of industry associations having unclear or misaligned positions, we have offered guidance and support to help reach an aligned conclusion and agree on a way forward.
In some circumstances, an industry association may be advocating for policy change that runs counter to Unilever’s interests or position.
In these circumstances, our preference is to engage with the industry association to: 1.
Make clear how its position is misaligned with ours.
Assess why the position is misaligned.
Determine if and how the position(s) can change, and over what time period.
Provide and agree specific recommendations for how the industry association can address misalignment.
5. Review progress of agreed actions.
This process is led by the Unilever relationship manager who manages the day-to-day relationship with the industry association.
We believe that an industry association’s continuous improvement is more important and constructive than setting deadlines to reach alignment.
If an industry association’s position cannot be made consistent with Unilever’s, or no improvement is made to reach alignment over a 12-month period, the issue is escalated to the budget holder.
At this point, we will determine whether to withdraw our membership and make our withdrawal public.
In some instances, there may be a disagreement regarding positions taken, but Unilever may decide that its interests are best served by retaining membership.
If this happens, Unilever reserves the right to make a public statement to this effect.
We will then continue to work with the industry association to seek to align its climate policy position with Unilever’s.
In other instances, associations may be aligned with Unilever’s position but not active in engagement.
In these circumstances, we will work with the industry association to determine how they can become more proactive in this space.
Climate policy engagement in action Since CPER 2023 was published, we now disclose policy engagement in line with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).
This disclosure goes beyond compliance; we use this to identify key areas of engagement, ensure they align with our policy ambitions, and improve governance.
The full statement is disclosed in Unilever’s Annual Report and Accounts.
Below are some examples of the actions we took in 2024 to address our policy priorities on climate: Priority 1: Raise the ambition of national climate strategies and plans in key markets to align with a 1.5°C pathway.
In February, Unilever supported the launch of ‘Mission 2025’.
This is a coalition of real economy leaders urging governments to align their upcoming national climate plans with the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.13 2.
In September, Unilever published a briefing to outline how business can support stronger NDCs, and how governments can catalyse private sector action.14 3.
In November, Unilever attended COP29 to outline how and why NDCs should be seen as five-year investment plans that can bring positive benefits to business and nations alike.15 Priority 2: Ensure carbon is priced at levels necessary for the delivery of the Paris Agreement.
In 2024, Unilever discussed the future of corporate climate frameworks and the role of voluntary carbon markets with groups like the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) and the Natural Climate Solutions Alliance (NCSA) to understand their impact on our climate targets.
In May, at the EU level, Unilever participated in FoodDrinkEurope meetings with the European Commission’s Head of Unit for Land Economy and Carbon Removals on the EU Emission Trading System for agri-food.
In October, Unilever signed a WEF COP29 letter supporting the expansion of carbon pricing to strengthen overall climate ambition.16 Priority 3: Scale up renewable energy capacity and the rapid phase­ out of fossil fuels, including fossil fuel subsidies.
In May, Unilever signed a letter calling on the EU to set a greenhouse gas emissions 12 https://www.unilever.com/files/unilever-climate-policy-engagement-review.pdf 13 https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/press-release/global-coalition-launches-to-boost-government-climate-plans-ahead-of-critical-undeadline 14 Driving Corporate Climate Action with Bold National Climate Commitments 15 https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2024/cop29-five-ways-business-and-government-can-collaborate-on-climate 16 Governments and business must double-downon climate action | World Economic Forum 11 12 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 reduction target of at least 90% by 2040, underlining the importance of phasing out fossil fuels and tripling the rate of deployment of renewables.
In June, Unilever, in collaboration with the We Mean Business Coalition, called on leaders at the G7 summit in Italy to set clear plans and timelines for the scale-up of renewable energy capacity and the rapid phase-out of fossil fuels.
Also in June, Unilever, along with the UK Deputy Ambassador and British Chambers of Commerce, met with Vietnam’s new Vice Minister of Industry and Trade.
The session focused on promoting a green transition, renewable energy, and improving trade relations.
18 17 Priority 4: Support forest protection and nature restoration.
In October, Unilever supported the Business for Nature COP16 statement that called for renewed policy ambition to implement the Global Biodiversity Framework and halt and reverse nature loss this decade.19 2.
In November, Unilever attended COP16 to advocate for policies that require governments and businesses to protect, restore and ensure the sustainable use of nature, as well as promote regenerative agriculture practices.20 Priority 5: Encourage the evolution of the GHG Protocol Standards to incentivise emissions reduction actions in value chains.
In 2024, Unilever actively engaged in the development of the GHG Protocol’s Land Sector and Removals Guidance through our participation in relevant WBCSD working groups and our membership of the Value Change Initiative.
Priority 6: Specific policies in individual action areas that support our Business Groups.
Examples: • Reformulating products: Ensure Standards of Identity rules are not a barrier to portfolio development.
• Throughout 2024, we developed our portfolio to meet the needs of our consumers.
We did so despite restrictive standards of identity and we continue to engage, where possible and appropriate, with regulators and industry partners to modernise rules and industry standards, ensuring we continue to provide full and safe choices for consumers.
• Forest-risk commodities: Advocate for policies that facilitate the maintenance of a deforestation-free supply chain even when sourcing increasing volumes of ingredients in a competitive market.

In March, we participated in a FoodDrinkEurope workshop and regularly engaged with the European Parliament and Commission on the implementation of the regulation.
Unilever has publicly opposed reopening the substance of the regulation.21 • Regenerative agriculture: Lobby for a regulatory landscape that supports farmers to transition to and maintain a regenerative agriculture approach.
• In July, Unilever and over 500 companies signed a letter urging Congress to pass the Farm Bill in 2024.
The Farm Bill would support conservation funding and sustainable solutions for clean air and water.22 • We actively participated in London Climate Action Week and Climate Week NYC, in June and September respectively, advocating for scaling of regenerative agriculture.23 • Chemical ingredients: Create a level playing field that supports national policies that rapidly accelerate the scale-up of non-fossil chemical feedstocks and addresses energy emissions from ingredient production.
• In May, Unilever hosted an event in Brussels bringing together EU policymakers, trade unions, and key industry stakeholders to discuss how to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from chemical ingredients.24 • Packaging: Advocate for the development of well-designed extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes, the scaling of reusable packaging models, and an ambitious and legally binding Global Plastics Treaty.
• Throughout 2024, Unilever has been advocating for an ambitious UN treaty to end plastic pollution based on mandatory global rules across the full lifecycle of plastic, through our position as co-chair of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty.25, 26 • Logistics: Support policies for clean transportation infrastructure, like renewable energy and EV infrastructure.
• Unilever advocated for a smoother and faster transition to clean transportation through our membership of industry associations.
We believe in the power of collective action and continue to support collaborative initiatives.
• Ice-cream cabinets: Improve access to renewable energy and remove barriers to warming up the cold chain.
• Due to the planned demerger of the Ice-cream business, advocacy work in this area is under review.

Engagement on scaling up renewables and engagement on phasing out fossil fuels are now assessed separately (previously, these were grouped under the heading of ‘renewables/energy transition’).
For renewables and fossil fuel phase-out, we have introduced a rating system to measure how actively trade associations engage with these issues (see red and green dots in the summary table: 1 dot = minimal engagement; 3 dots = high engagement).
This will enable us to track progress in a more granular way over time.
Where an association’s position on a particular priority has shifted relative to last year’s review, this is indicated with an up or down arrow.

In September, ANDI’s President criticised the Colombian government’s tax reform project (Reforma Tributaria) which included plans to expand and increase Colombia’s national carbon tax.
But it is unclear to what extent (if any) ANDI’s concerns about the tax reforms were to do with the carbon tax component.35 Alignment assessment Misaligned on rapid fossil fuel phase-out Engagement intensity Low Change(s) relative to previous assessment There has been no discernible shift in ANDI’s climate policy positions during 2024.
Its top-line messaging remains generally supportive of climate action and Colombia’s NDC.
Its detailed engagement continues to be mixed – specifically in the areas of carbon pricing (though its engagement on this topic in 2024 appears to be minimal) and the energy transition (ANDI supports expanding both renewables and fossil gas).

Unilever role(s) Board member Top-line positions Minimal mention of climate change in public messaging ABIA makes few explicit references to climate change in its top-line messaging and has not taken a clear position on the Paris Agreement or the Brazilian government’s NDC.
In its 2024 annual report, ABIA discloses that it participated in preparatory meetings ahead of COP28 and that the energy transition and deforestation were both discussed – but no detail of ABIA’s position on these topics is provided.36 Highlighting importance of regenerative agriculture ABIA has publicly acknowledged the role of regenerative agriculture practices in mitigating climate change, emphasising that the food sector is already investing in line with the Ministry of Agriculture’s low-carbon agriculture plan.
No indication is given of whether ABIA supports further incentives for regenerative agriculture beyond existing policies.37 Detailed advocacy positions No evidence of specific climate-related lobbying by ABIA was found.
ABIA did actively oppose a tax reform proposal that included within it a plan to introduce a surcharge on foods deemed environmentally harmful or unhealthy.
ABIA argued that taxes on food in Brazil are already high and further tax increases would harm consumers through higher food prices.38 We consider this to be a legitimate objection.

Unilever role(s) Council member Top-line positions High-level support for 1.5°C and A Just Transition BLSA has expressed support for limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and for South Africa’s Climate Change Act, which was signed into law in July 2024.44 It has also voiced support for a Just Transition, calling for transitioning the economy in a way that ensures justice for those whose jobs and livelihoods are at risk.45 Mixed position on the energy transition BLSA has voiced support for renewables, indicating that South Africa’s ‘green transition’ provides opportunities, for example, via green hydrogen, green electricity generation, mining critical minerals, and battery storage.46 At the same time, it has raised concerns about the Department of Mineral Resources & Energy’s insufficient preparations for an imminent gas supply crunch and, in that context, advocates for investment in fossil gas supply and infrastructure.
47 Detailed advocacy positions Support for policies to enable renewable energy deployment BLSA has consistently supported policies to enable and incentivise faster deployment of renewables in 2024.
For example, it applauded the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement (REIPPP) Programme and credited recent changes in regulation as a key driver for private sector investment in renewable energy production.48 BLSA also acknowledged the role of government in incentivising household and business investment in rooftop solar, e.g.
via tax incentives.49 44 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/645/BLSA_CEONewsletter_Jul24_AccessedOct24-0ba409f7cd3f43bfbf443c57f177ff39.pdf 45 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/645/23_AccessedOct24-111fd5946a7349c487c392a57013bb47.pdf 46 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/645/BLSA_PressRelease_Aug24_AccessedOct24-84dd82ef58c54da59175d26588c7a31b.pdf; https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/645/23_AccessedOct24-e904739338a841e1817704034c1ee989.pdf 47 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/645/BLSA_PressRelease_Aug24_AccessedOct24-84dd82ef58c54da59175d26588c7a31b.pdf; https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/382/BLSA_EngineeringNews_MAr24_AccessedApr24.pdf; https://content.influencemap.org/site/ data/001/645/BLSA_CEONewsletter_Jan24_AccessedOct24-2efefca550d14988985c96372118eda5.pdf 48 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/645/BLSA_CEONewsletter_Mar24_AccessedOct24-bb1fd6e311584acd822fb9f15e3d8213.pdf 49 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/645/BLSA_CEONewsletter_Feb24_AccessedOct24-dac1aa8d803646dbb5da5fe40540fc1d.pdf; https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/645/BLSA_CEONewsletter_5Feb24_AccessedOct24-e8d44536fc104f23a608d51c8a1aad4e.pdf; https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/645/BLSA_CEONewsletter_Dec23_AccessedOct24-59edf480027245abb396015dbb2506c5.pdf 50 https://blsa.org.za/thought-leadership/blsas-ceos-weekly-newsletter-the-latest-version-of-the-irp-needs-to-be-reworked-immediately/ https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/645/BLSA_CEONewsletter_May24_AccessedOct24-166e255b04aa42a7ba4bb67734842ae2.pdf 51 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/395/BLSA_TheCitizen_May24_AccessedMay24.pdf 52 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/645/BLSA_CEONewsletter_March24_AccessedOct24-d020adc49c274c5e9580b5d92397e0f7.pdf In addition, BLSA critiqued the South African government’s Integrated Resources Plan published in early 2024, arguing that its target for new renewable energy capacity to be installed via public procurement by 2030 was too low and its reliance on fossil gas was too high.50 Support for new fossil gas infrastructure BLSA was publicly critical of the South African government’s Gas Master Plan for failing to show how security of gas supply will be maintained for South African industry beyond 2026.51 BLSA has called for the government to create ‘an enabling environment for the necessary licensing’ to bring new gas sources online.52 Alignment assessment Misaligned on rapid fossil fuel phase-out Engagement intensity Low* Change(s) relative to previous assessment Overall, BLSA’s engagement on climate policy does not appear to have changed significantly in 2024, though some of its more detailed positions have evolved.
In last year’s review, it was found to be misaligned with Unilever on the issue of carbon pricing.
This year, BLSA has not lobbied either for or against measures to increase carbon prices.
Meanwhile, on the energy transition, it remains a staunch advocate for renewables, but has also been vocal about the need for investment in new fossil gas during 2024 – a position that is not fully consistent with Unilever’s stance on the need for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels.
*BLSA’s engagement intensity score from InfluenceMap (at the time this assessment was completed) is 11%, which is 1% below the threshold for ‘low engagement’ (as opposed to ‘no meaningful engagement’).
Yet, based on the detailed assessment above, it is clear that BLSA has engaged on climate policy in a way that goes beyond generic topline statements during the review period.
Therefore, its engagement intensity rating has been adjusted to reflect this.

Unilever role(s) Member and active participant in several working groups Top-line positions Support for EU climate goals – with a strong emphasis on not harming the European chemical industry’s competitiveness Cefic’s messaging regarding the EU Green Deal has been fairly neutral over 2024.
Its emphasis has been on calling for complementary measures – particularly an EU Industrial Deal – that ensure European industry is supported to decarbonise in ways that do not harm and, ideally, enhance its competitiveness.53 Along with other bodies representing energy-intensive industries, Cefic emphasises the importance of keeping energy costs low.54 While this leads Cefic at times to appear hesitant about specific measures, its engagement appears to be more constructive than obstructive.
Detailed advocacy positions Support for a wide range of renewable and low-carbon technologies Cefic has engaged constructively on policies designed to decarbonise electricity and industry in the EU over 2024.
It advocates in favour of nuclear, hydrogen (both blue and green) wind, solar, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS).
It has also called on European policymakers to prioritise improving grid connections and faster permitting for renewables.
Constructive engagement on promoting uptake of sustainable chemical feedstocks Cefic has consistently spoken up about the need for policy support to incentivise innovation and deployment of nonfossil sources of carbon in the chemical sector over 2024.
In April, it endorsed a joint statement issued by a group of European national governments calling for an EU-level ‘Sustainable Carbon Policy Package’ to promote a switch to sustainable feedstocks in the chemical industry.55 In June, Cefic’s Director General spoke at a Unilever-hosted event in Brussels to promote EU-level policy action to cut emissions from the chemicals used in cleaning products.56 53 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/393/Antwerpdeclaration_feb2024.pdf https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/628/Cefic_Innovation_9_points_plan_Sep_2024-28440fe3124c4b23941d5c88a4b1fc78.pdf 54 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/572/Cefic_Transition_pathway_July_2024-0e84b4296a9d47acad6133fdb59db768.pdf 55 https://cefic.org/media-corner/newsroom/access-to-sustainable-carbon-will-be-a-major-enabler-for-the-transformation-of-the-chemical-sector 56 https://www.linkedin.com/posts/unilever_eu-policy-event-activity-7199801284567146497-peEF/ https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rupertposner_accelerating-the-necessary-shift-to-bio-based-activity-7199478411109564417-FtNU/ In September, Cefic published a nine-point plan to boost the EU chemical industry’s innovation leadership, in which it called on policymakers to implement ‘market-pull mechanisms to stimulate demand in innovative net zero, low-carbon and circular products’.57 Detailed input on the methodology for calculating emissions savings from low-carbon fuels In June 2024, Cefic, alongside a number of other industry associations, provided detailed feedback to the European Commission on its proposed Low-Carbon Fuels Certification Delegated Act.
The input was broadly constructive, with some technical caveats (for example, regarding the technical maturity and availability of hydrogen leakage detection technologies).58 Cefic provided further feedback on the Act in October 2024, again calling for some technical amendments – for example, to make carbon captured from industrial sources fully eligible to be utilised in low-carbon fuel.59 Highlighting risk of carbon leakage in relation to reforms of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) Cefic’s messaging on carbon pricing has continued to emphasise the role of free allocations and indirect cost compensation for companies affected by the EU ETS as an effective means of mitigating the risk of carbon and investment leakage.60 Its support for the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) which is also designed to mitigate these risks, remains heavily caveated – though its engagement on the topic is constructive in that it details clear recommendations about how to make CBAM work for the European chemical industry.61 Alignment assessment No misalignment Engagement intensity High Change(s) relative to previous assessment Cefic continues to engage actively on EU climate policy and does so in a broadly constructive manner.
Its topline messaging emphasises the importance of preserving and enhancing the European chemical industry’s competitiveness even more so than previously.
We consider this to be entirely legitimate, so long as Cefic continues to work constructively on resolving tensions between decarbonisation and competitiveness.

Its position on grid decarbonisation has become marginally more positive during 2024.
Its position on carbon pricing (EU ETS and CBAM) remains highly nuanced, but it appears to be engaging in good faith with a view to making these policies work.
Therefore, it has been assessed as neutral on carbon pricing (as opposed to obstructive, as it was in last year’s review).
It has increased engagement on fossil-free chemical scaleup in 2024.

Detailed advocacy positions Support for specific measures to decarbonise energy and industry in the UK During 2024, CBI has called for the creation of a Net Zero Investment Plan to crowd in private finance, ‘green’ tax credits and capital allowances to incentivise industry investment in clean technologies, and a strategic prioritisation process for grid connections.
It claims to have successfully persuaded the (previous) Chancellor of the Exchequer to cut the time it takes to build electricity transmission infrastructure and obtain connections to the grid in November 2023 – and has continued to advocate for planning reform during 2024.64 Constructive engagement on plans for a UK Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism CBI has continued to express support for plans to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).65 In its response to the Autumn Budget in October 2024, it expressed concerns that the UK Government’s plan does not align with the EU’s CBAM implementation and promised to continue to campaign on the importance of UK-EU linkage on carbon pricing policy.66 Indirect support for fossil gas expansion While CBI has not directly spoken out in support of fossil fuels during 2024, it continues to be indirectly associated with the promotion of new fossil gas via its membership of BusinessEurope.
For example, the ‘Brussels Declaration’ issued by BusinessEurope’s Council of Presidents in November 2023 calls for investment in natural gas capacities, as well as renewables and nuclear.67 Alignment assessment Misaligned on rapid fossil fuel phase-out Engagement intensity Moderate Change(s) relative to previous assessment There has been no discernible shift in CBI’s climate policy positions during 2024.
Its Top-line messaging remains overwhelmingly positive, and it is constructively engaged on policies to accelerate decarbonisation of the UK energy grid as well as on carbon pricing and wider tax reforms to incentivise investment in clean technologies.
The only significant blemish on its record as an advocate of science-based policies is a result of its affiliation with BusinessEurope, which seems to take fewer pro-climate positions than CBI does – in particular, promoting fossil gas expansion.

The substance of its positions does not appear to have changed dramatically.
It remains a strong supporter of renewables, electrification and green hydrogen, while also indicating that it supports some expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure.
Based on the evidence available, its pro-renewables advocacy appears to have comfortably outweighed its pro-fossil fuels advocacy during the period of this review.
*CII’s engagement intensity has been rated as moderate despite only receiving a 21% engagement intensity score from InfluenceMap, which is 3% below the threshold for ‘moderate engagement’.
Yet, based on the detailed assessment above, it is clear that CII has engaged on climate policy, particularly energy policy, in detail.
Therefore, its engagement intensity rating has been adjusted to reflect this.
This is the same engagement intensity rating as CII received last year.

Detailed advocacy positions increase the budget allocated to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and to provide financing support for offshore wind development.72 In its 2023–24 Annual Report, CII indicated that it provided input on the Draft Delhi Solar Policy and advocated for ‘defining clear timelines for granting all necessary No Objection Certificates (NOCs) related to solar plant projects’ to accelerate solar energy infrastructure development.73 Additionally, CII has advocated for the electrification of mobility, including investments in EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure.
It has called for power generation companies to innovate in emissions reduction technologies, including carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and emphasised the role of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels.74 It has also been active in promoting policies to accelerate the development of a green hydrogen industry.
Via its Taskforce on Green Hydrogen, CII advocates in favour of subsidies and demand aggregation measures to make green hydrogen competitive with conventional hydrogen (i.e.
hydrogen produced from fossil gas).75 At the same time, CII has called for an increase in coal gasification capacity (without referencing CCS) and for taxes on petrol and diesel to be reduced.76 It states that there is a need (for energy security reasons) to continue to ‘explore and sustain supplies from traditional energy sources’ while transitioning to renewables.77 Neutral position on the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) CII appears to have accepted the EU CBAM as a done deal and is now engaged in how to make it work best for Indian industry (as opposed to fighting it, as others have continued to do).
It has called for the tax revenue to be collected in India and used to support small businesses to decarbonise.78 Alignment assessment Misaligned on rapid fossil fuel phase-out Engagement intensity Moderate* 79 https://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/environmental-sustainability/net-zero/; https://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/environmental-sustainability/forest-positive 72 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/385/CII_Communique_Feb2024_AccessedApril2024.pdf 73 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/385/CII_CompetitiveandSustainableIndiaReport_March2024_AccessedApril2024.pdf 74 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/632/CII_AR_2024_AccessedOct2024p24-38-fec41faf770346e7adfecafc8039942b.pdf; https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/632/CII_AR_2024_AccessedOct2024p95-99-1458e1156ffa40e2bb5ff3ccb5781222.pdf; https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/385/CII_Communique_Oct2023_AccessedApril2024.pdf; https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/341/CII_Blog_ Nov2023.pdf 75 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/385/CII_Communique_Oct2023_AccessedApril2024.pdf 76 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/385/CII_Communique_Feb2024_AccessedApril2024.pdf; https://www.thehindu.com/business/ slash-petroleum-taxes-cheaper-crude-not-reflecting-in-prices-cii/article68305317.ece 77 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/341/CII_PressRelease_Nov2023.pdf 78 https://content.influencemap.org https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/347/CBAM_TheHindu_December2023.pdf 33 34 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 81 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/381/CLG_Mar2024_2040_climate_target_business_letter.pdf 82 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/664/CLG_uk_policy_briefing_making_it_happen_Oct2024-a3a0498dad2a43b19ccfaf595e4b218b.pdf 83 https://content.influencemap.org//site/data/001/664/CLG_uk_policy_briefing_making_it_happen_Oct2024-a3a0498dad2a43b19ccfaf595e4b218b.pdf 84 https://content.influencemap.org/site/data/001/339/CLG_principles_for_an_ambitious_eu_green_industrial_strategy_Nov2023.pdf; https://content.

Detailed advocacy positions It is unclear to what extent CGF has engaged with policymakers on climate-relevant policies over 2024.
In a July 2024 interview, CGF’s Sustainability Director expressed a desire to engage constructively with EU regulators (both in general and specifically in relation to the EU Deforestation Regulation) but it is not clear from CGF’s public disclosure whether such engagement has taken place.80 Alignment assessment No misalignment Engagement intensity No meaningful engagement Change(s) relative to previous assessment There has been no discernible shift in CGF’s positions during 2024.

Detailed advocacy positions Pushing for increased ambition in UK and EU climate targets During 2024, CLG Europe called on EU policymakers to set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 90% by 2040.81 It has publicly advocated for an ambitious EU Green Industrial Strategy, setting clear criteria for what this needs to contain.82 Meanwhile, ahead of COP29 in November 2024, CLG UK called on the UK government to set an ambitious 2035 NDC (which it did) as well as to focus on implementing its existing 2030 NDC (which it is not currently on track to meet, according to the UK Climate Change Committee).83 Support for phasing out fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies Both CLG UK and CLG Europe have called for policymakers in the UK, EU and globally (via COP agreements) to commit to phasing out unabated fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies and to ensure these are backed up with clear phase-out plans and timelines.84 This is in addition to measures to scale up renewable capacity and improve energy efficiency across industry and the built environment.
Alignment assessment No misalignment Engagement intensity High Change(s) relative to previous assessment CLG continues to be constructively engaged on climate policy in the EU and UK, pushing policymakers to increase the ambition of emissions reduction targets and to back these up with robust implementation plans.
It is highly engaged overall, though this is mostly limited to support for ambitious climate policy in general rather than detailed engagement on specific policies (this is consistent with what we found in last year’s review).

However, details on what this means in terms of concrete policy positions remain unclear.
In its manifesto for the 2024 European elections, the sole reference to the Green Deal legislative agenda is a call for ‘coherence and consistency across different pieces of legislation stemming from the European Green Deal’.85 Detailed advocacy positions Support for a European Industrial Deal to complement the EU Green Deal Cosmetics Europe was a signatory to the Antwerp Declaration in February 2024, which calls for a European Industrial Deal to complement the Green Deal.
The Declaration’s key climate policy-related asks are for the European Commission to: a) include a strong public funding chapter with a Clean Tech Deployment Fund, and b) boost demand for net zero, low-carbon and circular products, including through public procurement and by expanding the scope of the Net Zero Industry Act.86 Alignment assessment No misalignment Engagement intensity No meaningful engagement Change(s) relative to previous assessment There has been no discernible shift in Cosmetics Europe’s climate policy positions during 2024.
Its top-line messaging remains positive, but it does not appear to engage on climate policy beyond signing high-level statements such as the Antwerp Declaration (referenced above).

Unilever role(s) Head of Unilever Netherlands, General Manager Nutrition Unilever Europe and METR/ANZ, is on the General Board and the Daily Board.
Top-line positions Support for EU and Dutch climate goals During 2024, VNO-NCW has consistently voiced its support for national and international climate targets – both interim 2030 targets and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 (in line with the existing stated ambitions of the Dutch government and European Commission).
It has emphasised the need for supportive policies to enable these targets to be met, while also addressing energy affordability issues that are particularly acute in the Netherlands.87 Detailed advocacy positions Support for policies to accelerate energy transition VNO-NCW has, on multiple occasions, called for measures to accelerate the transformation of energy infrastructure to support the electrification of transport and industry along with a greater share of renewables in the energy mix.
This includes taking constructive positions on improving grid infrastructure, the role of hydrogen, and using proceeds from the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to invest in transforming energy infrastructure.88 37 38 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 EU Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) Geography China Sector Cross-industry Membership payment Under €20,000 p.a.
Unilever role(s) • Vice Chair of EUCCC’s Agriculture, Food and Beverage Working Group • Core member of Cosmetics Advisory Committee • Member of multiple working groups Top-line positions High-level support for European and Chinese climate goals EUCCC has acknowledged ‘climate change is the biggest challenge that all of us must face’ and has expressed support for both the European Union’s and China’s carbon neutrality targets.92 EUCCC’s webinars and working group meetings include updates on EU regulations such as the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).
However, its engagement on these topics appears to be primarily about information sharing rather than advocacy (with a few exceptions, outlined below).93 Detailed advocacy positions Support for the green energy transition EUCCC has called for further collaboration between China and the EU to accelerate the energy transition and appears to have engaged constructively with policymakers on the issue of green energy procurement.94 For example, in December 2023, EUCCC and a delegation of member companies met with a representative of the Ministry of Commerce to discuss the obstacles to green energy procurement.95 Further, in May 2024, EUCCC attended a roundtable with the National Energy Administration and the Shenzhen Energy Bureau, where it communicated the challenges SMEs face in terms of green energy and certification, requesting government support.96 Detailed advocacy positions Support for current carbon pricing regime VNO-NCW clearly acknowledges the EU ETS as a key tool in driving decarbonisation.89 In relation to the Netherlands’ national carbon tax, it argues that government must now accelerate progress on creating the infrastructure to enable businesses to decarbonise and thus avoid paying high carbon costs.
Specifically, VNO-NCW highlights that there are currently thousands of Dutch businesses awaiting a grid connection to enable them to switch from gas to electricity.
In a July 2024 position paper, VNO-NCW recommends that businesses that can demonstrate they have electrification plans ready should be exempted from the national carbon tax and the higher rate of energy tax on gas.90 We regard this as a reasonable proposal – clearly intended to incentivise faster action on energy infrastructure transformation, rather than an attempt to weaken carbon pricing signals per se.
Indirect support for fossil gas expansion While VNO-NCW has not directly spoken out in support of fossil fuels during 2024, it continues to be indirectly associated with the promotion of new fossil gas via its membership of BusinessEurope.
For example, the ‘Brussels Declaration’ issued by BusinessEurope’s Council of Presidents in November 2023 calls for investment in natural gas capacities, as well as renewables and nuclear.91 Alignment assessment Misaligned on rapid fossil fuel phase-out Engagement intensity Moderate Change(s) relative to previous assessment VNO-NCW’s climate policy positions have remained broadly consistent during 2024.
Its top-line messaging remains overwhelmingly positive, and it appears to have somewhat increased the intensity of its constructive engagement in support of energy transition policies.
It also appears to have dropped any reference to expanding fossil fuel infrastructure from its direct advocacy and communications, though it still remains indirectly associated with pro-fossil fuel advocacy as a result of its membership of BusinessEurope.

For example, in a May 2024 speech, the EUCCC Chair called the EU CBAM a ‘very important EU policy,’ and emphasised the need for cooperation between China and Europe.99 Further, EUCCC was a supporting organisation for an April 2024 training session on the interpretation of the EU CBAM for Chinese businesses, stating that the CBAM acts as an incentive to Sichuan businesses to establish carbon accounting capabilities and drive ‘carbon competitiveness’ towards low carbon.100 Support for EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) EUCCC appears to support the EU CSDDD.
For example, EUCCC was a lead author of the European Business Organisation (EBO) Worldwide Network EU CSDDD Position Paper, published in June 2024.
The paper calls for further clarification of CSDDD guidelines and for the CSDDD to ‘become a directly applicable EU-wide regulation’.101 Alignment assessment No misalignment Engagement intensity Low Change(s) relative to previous assessment EUCCC’s top-line messaging on climate policy has not shifted over 2024.
In terms of detailed policy engagement, it has been less active on carbon pricing and more active on support for renewables during 2024 than it had been in the previous review period.
Significantly, too, it does not appear to have advocated for gas as a transition fuel during 2024, meaning that the one area of partial misalignment with science-based policy identified in last year’s review no longer applies.

*ECTA’s engagement intensity has been rated as moderate despite only receiving a 15% engagement intensity score from InfluenceMap.

Its support for fossil gas is caveated: it acknowledges the importance of setting clear phase-out dates for new fossil gas infrastructure, addressing methane emissions and creating a CCUS ecosystem.109 Conditional support for EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) reform ERT’s tone regarding CBAM has shifted during 2024 to become more constructive.
It still expresses reservations about the policy as currently designed, but appears more eager to engage constructively to help make CBAM work than was previously the case.
Likewise, it appears to have accepted the European Commission’s position on phasing out free ETS allowances alongside the phase-in of CBAM.
However, ERT continues to raise concerns that this will reduce the export competitiveness of European energyintensive industries.110 Alignment assessment Misaligned on rapid fossil fuel phase-out Engagement intensity Moderate Geography EU Sector Cross-industry Membership payment Between €20,000 and €49,999 p.a.

It remains highly concerned about high energy costs for European industry but has evolved its engagement on carbon pricing via CBAM and ETS reform in a more constructive direction.
This is emblematic of ERT’s overall direction of travel: it recognises that decarbonisation and competitiveness need to go hand-in-hand and appears more committed than it has in the past to presenting policy ideas that optimise for both.
ERT has expressed support for new fossil gas infrastructure during 2024 – albeit with caveats that go some way towards allaying concerns about fossil fuel lock-in.
Nonetheless, ERT’s position on this issue is not fully consistent with Unilever’s stance on the need for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels.

It has also concretely committed to support delivery on the government’s target of increasing non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity to 500GW by 2030 via its Renewable Energy Developers Taskforce.111 It also has taskforces on energy storage and solar manufacturing with complementary aims.
Mixed position on the energy transition FICCI has indicated support for increasing renewable energy investment and storage capacity.112 Additionally, FICCI supported the scale-up of solar manufacturing and green hydrogen production via committees specific to these topics.113 It has also supported the expansion of fossil gas as a transition fuel in India, highlighting the role of gas in power generation (as a substitute for coal) transport and industry.114 FICCI also has a committee for Oil & Gas – Upstream, focused on increasing investments in the sector.115 High-level support for carbon markets FICCI appears to be broadly supportive of the Indian government’s plans to develop robust carbon markets and implement a carbon credit trading scheme, though it does not appear to be engaged on the detail of policy design in this area.116 It acknowledges the value of an effective carbon price in driving innovation and decarbonisation.117 Detailed advocacy positions Constructive engagement on EV subsidy scheme FICCI has advocated for a five-year extension to the current EV subsidy scheme – the Fast Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) II scheme – to incentivise EV adoption.118 Alignment assessment Misaligned on rapid fossil fuel phase-out Engagement intensity Low Geography India Sector Cross-industry Membership payment Under €20,000 p.a.

Unilever role(s) Member of climate and environment, agriculture committees Top-line positions Support for the Paris Agreement and EU climate goals FoodDrinkEurope’s top-line messaging continues to be supportive of the Paris Agreement – including specific references to 1.5°C – and the EU’s 2050 carbon neutrality target.
It set out its high-level climate policy asks in a June 2024 report.
These include ensuring access to renewable energy for manufacturing businesses of all sizes; strengthening the EU Common Agricultural Policy and other agricultural initiatives to support sustainable farming; and developing new funding pathways to meet the €30 billion+ investment needed to transition to sustainable farming practices across Europe.119 Detailed advocacy positions Constructive engagement on implementing the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) In May 2024, FoodDrinkEurope co-signed a letter to the European Commission President that highlighted concrete 119 https://www.fooddrinkeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Action-Project-for-Sustainable-Resilient-Food-Systems-2024.pdf Issues with the EUDR Information System and presented clear recommendations for overcoming problems with the initial version of the System.120 FoodDrinkEurope’s Director General also flagged these concerns publicly in June.121 We judge these interventions to be constructive since the recommendations presented to the Commission were practical and achievable within the timeframe then available.
Support for a broad range of policies to incentivise more sustainable and regenerative agriculture practices FoodDrinkEurope’s Director General participated in the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of EU Agriculture, which published its final report in September 2024.
The report lays out a comprehensive policy agenda for shifting towards a more sustainable food system – including recommendations that align with a regulatory landscape that supports farmers to transition to and maintain a regenerative agriculture approach.
The report also highlights the desirability of dietary change (reducing consumption of animal proteins) though it has little to say about how this might be incentivised (beyond raising consumer awareness and using public procurement).122 Alignment assessment No misalignment Engagement intensity Moderate* Change(s) relative to previous assessment FoodDrinkEurope continues to have positive top-line messaging and to engage constructively on the issues of deforestation and regenerative agriculture.
The one change relative to last year’s review is that FoodDrinkEurope does not appear to have lobbied against measures to incentivise dietary change in 2024, which means we no longer consider it to be misaligned with science-based policy.
*FoodDrinkEurope’s engagement intensity score from InfluenceMap (at the time this assessment was completed) is 23%, which is 2% below the threshold for ‘moderate engagement’.
However, we believe this score does not fairly reflect the intensity of FoodDrinkEurope’s engagement during the review period, specifically because of the nature of the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of EU Agriculture.

SFPA also supports state-level policies to accelerate the expansion of renewable energy and land-based solutions.137 Detailed advocacy positions Proactive support for conservation and climate investments contained in the US Farm Bill In May 2024, SFPA wrote to the leadership of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, and the House Committee on Agriculture, calling on the Committees to ensure funding for conservation and climate programmes is sustained at current levels in the 2024 US Farm Bill.138 Support for policies to address deforestation in agricultural supply chains SFPA has expressed support for legislation that complements voluntary efforts to address deforestation.
Specifically, in March 2024, it released a high-level statement in support of the Fostering Overseas Rule of Law and Environmentally Sound Trade (FOREST) Act, arguing that it would provide ‘a credible framework with reasonable incentives and penalties to prevent illegal deforestation and ensure harmonization and enforcement between international jurisdictions’.139 Based on evidence in the public domain, this appears to be the extent of SFPA’s engagement on a potentially vital piece of legislation that has so far failed to make it through the US Congress.

Appendix 2: industry association review process and method Selection process This review covers 26 of Unilever’s industry associations.
For this update, we have included the same trade associations assessed in the CPER, published in March 2024.154 The associations were originally selected based on two criteria: 1.
The importance of the association for climate policy: indicators considered include the size of the market where the association is based – both in terms of Unilever’s presence and in terms of the country’s/region’s GHG emissions – and how material the sector/part of the economy represented is for the delivery of Unilever’s CTAP.
We have prioritised associations that represent sectors with high GHG emissions and where achieving Unilever’s climate goals is likely to be highly dependent on climate policy.
Unilever’s level of influence within the association: indicators considered include the amount spent annually on membership and whether Unilever has a position that could give us particular influence (e.g.
These criteria were incorporated into the screening and selection process as follows: 1.
An initial screening was conducted to remove associations: a) based outside of Unilever’s top 10 markets by turnover, and b) operating outside of the top 10 highest GHG-emitting countries.
This generated a longlist of associations.
Those that operate globally or regionally (e.g.
at EU level) were also included in this longlist.

Longlisted associations were then subjected to a selection process, where they were assigned a score out of five for each of the following: a) Geography: the size of the market/region where the association operates.
b) Sector: importance of the sector/industry the association represents for climate policy.
This includes a ‘sub-national’ categorisation for trade associations that represent industry at a state or city level.
c) Fees: the amount Unilever spends on annual membership.
The table below indicates how scores were assigned SCORE 1 2 3 4 5 Amount spent on membership (annual) Under €20,000 Between €20,000 and €49,999 Between €50,000 and €99,999 Between €100,000 and €299,999 Above €300,000 Geography Canada, UK, France, Mexico, Philippines, Germany Indonesia, Brazil US, India, China Regional Global Sector Sub-national155 Personal Care Consumer Goods, Home Care Food & Drink, Transport & logistics Cross-industry, Chemicals, Energy The scores for each of the three categories were added to obtain a total score out of 15.
All associations scoring 10 or above were automatically included, unless they do not engage on climate policy and there is no reason to believe they should (i.e.
because they are specifically set up to focus on other issues).
In addition, the following associations that scored eight or nine were included on the grounds that they are active in one of Unilever’s top five markets and represent at least one of our five Business Groups.
American Cleaning Institute (ACI) 2.
Associated Chamber of Commerce & Industry India (ASSOCHAM) 3.
Brazilian Food Industry Association (ABIA) 4.
China National Food Industry Association (CNFIA) 5.
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) 6.
European Union Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) 7.
Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce (FICCI) 8.
Indonesia Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KADIN) Finally, the following associations were included despite not meeting the selection criteria/ thresholds described above, on the grounds that they are already covered by InfluenceMap, whose data was used in this exercise (see further information below): 4.
Asociación Nacional de Empresarios de Colombia (ANDI) 2. Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) 3.
Dutch Employers’ Federation (VNO-NCW) 4.
National Business Initiative (South Africa) 5.
Tennessee Chamber of Commerce & Industry (TCCI) We acknowledge that this selection process may not have captured every association that is engaged, or should be engaged, on climate policy.
We aim to refine the selection methodology and update the list of associations covered as we issue further updates over time.
Assessment methodology What alignment means Once again, we commissioned Volans, a think tank and advisory firm, to conduct an independent review of our industry associations’ climate policy engagement.
As with our 2023 Review, all associations were assessed against Unilever’s climate policy priorities, as articulated in our Climate Transition Action Plan (see page 35) as well as against a broader science-based policy benchmark – specifically the IPCC’s 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C and its Sixth Assessment Report, published in 2023.156 Key areas of divergence are highlighted in the individual association assessments in Appendix 1.
For each policy priority, associations were assigned one of the following ratings: • Constructive (the association is actively engaged on this topic and its position is aligned with Unilever’s).
• Obstructive (the association is actively engaged on this topic, but its position is misaligned with Unilever’s).
• Inactive (the association is not actively engaged on this topic).
• Neutral (the association is at least somewhat engaged on this topic, but the net effect of its engagement is neither obstructive nor constructive).
• Passive support (the association endorses a government climate policy after the fact, but without evidence of constructive engagement ahead of time).
Based on these policy-level assessments, each association is also given an overall alignment rating: either ‘no misalignment’ or ‘misaligned on X issue’.
These ratings are based exclusively on evidence from the 12-month review period (Q4 2023 to Q4 2024 – evidence was gathered and assessed during October and November 2024).
Historic instances of misalignment prior to this review period have not been taken into account on the basis that these were covered in our previous review.
155 Sub-national was used to describe associations that represent a sector at a state (e.g.
US) or city level – such as the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce & Industry.
156 https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ 61 62 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 UNILEVER CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT REVIEW 2025 How Unilever’s policy priorities map onto the industry association review framework The industry association review focuses on associations’ engagement across seven distinct climate policy issues.
These correspond to the direct advocacy priorities listed in our CTAP and on page 6 as follows: • The first three ‘cross-cutting policies’ (ambitious NDCs, price on carbon, energy transition) with the third split into two separate categories to allow for a more granular understanding of how industry associations engage on energy policy: support for renewables and support for phasing out fossil fuels are distinct policy positions that do not always go hand-in-hand.
• The second, third and fourth ‘Business Group decarbonisation levers’ (forest-risk commodities, regenerative agriculture and chemical ingredients).
Industry associations have not been assessed against the other direct advocacy priorities listed on page 6.
This is because the other priorities are either about technical standards or issues in specific geographies that we do not anticipate the associations covered in this review being actively engaged on.
Ultimately, Unilever views climate policy engagement as a tool to help the company deliver on its net zero ambition and 2030 targets.
Therefore, each association’s policy positions were examined through the lens of whether, if implemented, they would help or hinder delivery of Unilever’s current Climate Transition Action Plan (published in 2024).
Alignment with the Paris Agreement The near-term emissions reduction targets set out in our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) were approved in 2024 by the Science Based Targets initiative, indicating that they are aligned with the Paris Agreement.
Unilever’s climate policy engagement focuses on issues that materially impact our ability to deliver our CTAP goals.
We are confident that Unilever’s climate policy positions are consistent with science-based policy required to meet the Paris Agreement.
By default, therefore, associations that were assessed as aligned with Unilever on a particular issue are also assumed to be aligned with science-based policy (and vice versa).
There are, however, some aspects of climate policy that Unilever does not engage with directly.
When an industry association was found to be active on a climate policy issue that Unilever does not have a clear public position on, the association’s positions were assessed relative to science-based policy benchmarks derived from the IPCC’s assessment of what is necessary to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial averages.157 The science-based policy benchmark assessment looked at all aspects of the association’s climate lobbying for which data was available – not just those aspects that correspond directly to Unilever’s policy priorities.
Again, notable areas of divergence from a sciencebased policy agenda are highlighted in the individual assessments.
What counts as alignment or misalignment?
Judging whether an association’s policy engagement is aligned with what is required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement is not always straightforward.
There is no single policy playbook for achieving 1.5°C.
There can and will be legitimate differences of opinion on what the most effective policies are in any given region or sector.
According to Climate Action Tracker, the current reality is that no government’s policies are yet compatible with a 1.5°C pathway.158 Therefore, if an association is pushing to weaken policy ambition and delay timelines, this is likely to indicate misalignment with ‘sciencebased policy’.
This doesn’t mean associations can be expected to provide support for every proposed climate law that affects their members.
However, it does mean that when an association opposes a specific climate policy proposal (e.g.
because it believes the proposed policy will adversely impact the competitiveness of the businesses it represents) it is incumbent on the association to engage constructively with policymakers to help find alternative policy options that would be (at least) equally effective at reducing emissions.
Importantly, the alternative proposals need to be viable too: refusing to support a climate policy that isn’t “perfect” can constitute obstructive lobbying if there is no realistic possibility of the “perfect” option being implemented given prevailing political conditions.
Detailed advocacy versus top-line statements The research focused, wherever possible, on associations’ actual engagement on specific policies – for example, responses to government consultations and statements given to the media commenting on policy proposals – rather than on top-line statements, such as generic endorsements of the Paris Agreement or the need to transition to net zero emissions, without reference to specific policies.
Additionally, the research concentrated on public evidence of policy engagement, rather than calls for voluntary action.
As a result, some associations are categorised as misaligned despite having made public statements in support of the Paris Agreement and net zero targets.
If an association opposes specific policies designed to help bend the emissions curve without offering credible, viable alternatives, this is counted as misalignment, regardless of whether the association nominally endorses the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Active versus passive alignment As well as assessing alignment, the research looked at how active and engaged each association is on climate policy overall.
This informed an assessment of whether an association’s alignment was passive (i.e.
not seeking to obstruct policies that are in line with Unilever’s policy positions and a science-based policy agenda) or active (i.e., taking concrete steps to promote such policies).
Each association gets an overall engagement intensity rating – from ‘no meaningful engagement’ to ‘high engagement’.
These ratings are based primarily on InfluenceMap’s engagement intensity scores.
The thresholds used are listed below: • No meaningful engagement: 0–11% • Low engagement: 12–24% • Moderate engagement: 25–49% • High engagement: >50% In a few specific borderline cases, Volans has adjusted an association’s rating on the basis that InfluenceMap’s scoring system generates a result that does not fairly reflect the true level of engagement.
In these cases, an explanation as to why an adjustment has been made is included in the detailed association review in the appendix.
The principle adopted here is that passive alignment is a minimum threshold, but Unilever is looking for more than a ‘do no harm’ stance on climate policy from its industry associations.

The primary source of information used was the LobbyMap platform, created by InfluenceMap, an independent think tank that tracks corporate and industry association climate policy engagement.159 Using this publicly available data, Volans reviewed the detail of each association’s engagement on specific policies, to assess whether its detailed positions were aligned or not.
As this is an update to Unilever’s CPER, we covered the 12-month period from Q4 2023 to Q4 2024 to provide an update on how our associations have engaged on climate policy since the last review.
Inevitably, this publicly available information provides an incomplete snapshot of associations’ climate policy engagement.
In some cases, associations are therefore likely to be doing more than is captured in this review.
Where we believe this to be the case, Unilever intends to work with the associations in question to increase the visibility of their climate policy work.
