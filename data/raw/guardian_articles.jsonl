Here are the latest developments: The attorney general, Pam Bondi, said that she is “deploying DOJ agents to ICE facilities—and wherever ICE comes under siege—to safeguard federal agents, protect federal property, and immediately arrest all individuals engaged in any federal crime.” Donald Trump posted a lengthy screed on social media in which he demanded that Microsoft fire its head of global affairs, Lisa Monaco. As deputy attorney general, Monaco had overseen criminal investigations of Trump’s effort to stay in office after losing the 2020 election and the Capitol riot on January 6 2021. Oregon lawmakers rejected Trump’s characterization of Portland as a scene of non-stop anarchy in dire need of federal troops as “a fable”. The FBI has fired about 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, AP reports. Asked by CNN to reflect on Trump’s second term so far, Kamala Harris replied: “It’s painful to see. I mean, what’s happening with Comey: Are you fucking kidding me? The United States Department of Justice?” The US supreme court on Friday extended an order that permits the Trump administration to not spend more than $4bn in congressionally appropriated foreign aid money that it is seeking to cancel. After the indictment of James Comey, the president told reporters that he hopes “more” political adversaries will be prosecuted. Both of Oregon’s senators and three of its representatives in Congress rejected Donald Trump’s latest false claims about mass anarchy in the city of Portland as a fiction intended to justify the unnecessary deployment of federal troops as part of an “authoritarian” crackdown. Speaking at a federal building in downtown Portland after oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facilities in the state, Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator, told reporters: “It’s important to recognize that the president’s argument is a fable, it does not resemble the truth.” “If he watches a TV show in the morning and he see Portland mentioned, he says it’s a terrible place,” Wyden added. During an Oval Office event to announce that the administration intends to investigate and disrupt what it claims is “organized political violence” funded by left-wing groups, Trump made several wild claims about Portland, which was a center of protests in 2020, after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, but life has long since returned to normal and barriers around the federal courthouse and police headquarters downtown have been removed. The president, however, apparently deceived by conservative outlets hyping video of a handful of protesters gathered outside an Ice facility in an outlying, residential neighborhood, insisted that the city has been in non-stop “anarchy” since 2020, and is barely livable. “Portland is, I don’t know how anybody lives there, it’s amazing. But it’s anarchy out there,” the president said. “You go out to Portland and you see what’s happening in Portland, this is like, nobody’s ever seen anything like it, every night, and this has gone on for years, they just burn the place down and you know the shop owners, most of them have left, but the few shops that are open, they just use plywood, just like 3/4 inch plywood, they don’t put store fronts in because they know it’s going to be burned down,” Trump insisted, falsely. Describing the small number of protesters who have gathered outside an Ice facility that has been illegally used for detentions in a residential southwest neighborhood, Trump claimed, without evidence: “These are professional agitators, these are bad people and they’re paid a lot of money by rich people.” “But we’re going to get out there and we’re gonna do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that,” the president said. “These aren’t your protesters that make the sign in their basement late in the evening because they really believe it,” the president added. “These are professional anarchists and agitators, and they get hired by wealthy people.” At Friday’s news conference, congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, an Oregon Democrat, said: “This proclaimed ‘war on Antifa’ is completely a fallacy. Antifa is an ideology, it is not a group, and so we’re extremely concerned with what he’s going to try to do with that pronouncement.” “Donald Trump does not care about safety. If he cared about safety he would not have released 1,600 convicted insurrectionists into the streets. He cares about control and authoritarianism,” she added. “Portland does not need the military. We do not want them, we do not need them, we do not welcome them to come here under his orders.” At the same news conference, Jeff Merkley, Oregon’s other Democratic senator, pointed out that when they visited the Ice facility this week, there were no protesters present at all. He also disputed the notion “that Trump is trying to make a rational point based on evidence.” “That is not correct. He is trying to project an image to justify forces that he can roll in to create chaos and then justify further authoritarian actions,” the senator added. He also drew attention to video evidence from the local newspaper, the Oregonian, which showed that a recent clash between federal agents and a small number of protesters outside the facility had been entirely due to violence by the agents against the protesters, who remained peaceful. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on Friday that she is “deploying DOJ agents to ICE facilities—and wherever ICE comes under siege—to safeguard federal agents, protect federal property, and immediately arrest all individuals engaged in any federal crime.” In her statement, posted on social media, Bondi added that she is responding to Donald Trump’s designation of certain forms of protest against immigration enforcement as acts of “terrorism” by instructing the FBI’s “Joint Terrorism Task Forces across the country to disrupt and investigate all entities and individuals engaged in acts of domestic terrorism, including the repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents.” “The Department of Justice,” Bondi said, “will seek the most serious available charges against all participants in these criminal mobs, including conspiracy offenses, assault offenses, civil disorder offenses, and terrorism offenses.” The FBI has fired about 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers prompted nationwide protests, three people familiar with the matter told the Associated Press. The bureau had first reassigned the agents last spring but has since fired them, said the people, who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel matters with The Associated Press. The number of FBI employees fired was not immediately clear, but two people said it was roughly 20. Jean-Frederic Dufour, the chief executive of Rolex, admitted in a letter to Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, that Donald Trump did bring up tariffs on Swiss imports, but only “in jest”, when he was a guest of the exclusive watchmaker during the US Open tennis final. Warren had written to the Rolex CEO to ask, given “the President’s record of doling out special treatment to CEOs who are able to woo him with flattery, payoffs, or both”, whether he had invited Trump to watch the match from the Rolex box shortly after high tariffs on goods from Switzerland were announced, “to curry favor with the President in an effort to secure special-interest exemptions for Rolex products”. “President Trump, never one to miss a rhetorical opportunity, did ask in jest whether he would have been invited had it not been for the tariffs – a moment that brought a round of laughter all around,” Dufour told Warren in a letter sent on Thursday. “Corruption is not a laughing matter,” Warren said in a statement on Friday. “While families are getting crushed by Trump’s chaotic tariffs, Donald Trump and his rich friends are laughing about tariffs in a fancy box sponsored by a luxury watch brand. How much more out of touch can Trump be?” The former vice-president, Kamala Harris, weighed in on the indictment of James Comey in blunt terms on Friday during an interview with CNN. Asked to reflect on Trump’s second term so far, Harris replied: “It’s painful to see. I mean, what’s happening with Comey: Are you fucking kidding me? The United States Department of Justice?” Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist and social media influencer who serves as an adviser to Donald Trump, has taken credit for the president demanding on Friday that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, the former deputy attorney general who coordinated investigations into Trump’s attempt to stay in power after losing the 2020 election. “After I alerted President Trump to the fact that [Microsoft] has hired Lisa Monaco to be their new President of Global Affairs, he has just called on Microsoft to terminate her employment,” Loomer wrote on X. She then tagged the Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella and asked him: “are you going to comply?” When Loomer first drew attention to Monaco’s hiring by Microsoft in July, she also noted that Reid Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor she described as a “Jeffrey Epstein associate” is “on the board of Microsoft.” When Trump was asked on Thursday in the Oval Office to name some of the “wealthy people” he was accusing of hiring “professional agitators” to carry out political violence, he said: “I hear names of some pretty rich people that are radical-left people… I hear about a guy named Reid Hoffman.” Days before hundreds of top US military commanders have been ordered to gather at a marine corps base in Virginia next week, Pentagon officials are preparing for possible strikes on suspected drug traffickers inside Venezuela in the coming weeks, NBC News reports, citing unnamed sources. Critics of Donald Trump have already accused him of seeking to use military strikes against suspected drug traffickers off the coast of Venezuela in recent weeks as a distraction from the clamor over his administration’s decision not to release files from the investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender Trump socialized with for more than a decade. If US strikes escalate to targets inside Venezuela, Democrats could echo the claims made by Republicans in 1998 when Bill Clinton fired dozens of Tomahawk missiles at a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan and a training camp in Afghanistan associated with Osama bin Laden. Those 20 August 1998 strikes were launched two weeks after al-Qaida had killed 224 people in bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, but also just three days after Clinton had admitted to an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. A chorus of Republicans quickly accused Clinton of trying to create a foreign crisis to distract attention away from the sex scandal, and the accusation was reflected on the banners and signs of Sudanese protesters who marched in Khartoum that weekend holding up a large, handmade sign with an image of Lewinsky emblazoned with the slogan: “No War for Monika.” At a Pentagon news conference after the strikes aimed at the then relatively unknown bin Laden, one reporter asked Clinton’s defense secretary, William Cohen, about suggestions that the timing of the attack bore “a striking resemblance to Wag the Dog”, the 1997 film about a White House that hires a Hollywood producer to create a fake war to divert the public from a sex scandal involving the president. “The only motivation driving this action today was our absolute obligation to protect the American people from terrorist activities,” Cohen replied. “That is the sole motivation.” “I don’t think any president, regardless of party, would ever take military action to distract from personal problems,” Dee Dee Myers, Clinton’s former press secretary, told Jay Leno that week in an appearance on the Tonight Show. “Most of the Congress, most of the American people I think, will say: ‘I don’t believe that our president, regardless of how bad things are, would do that.’” Donald Trump appeared to admit on Friday evening that his optimism about a deal to end the war in Gaza, expressed on Friday morning, had been premature. “I am pleased to report that we are having very inspired and productive discussions with the Middle Eastern Community concerning Gaza,” the president wrote on his personal social media platform, hours after Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told the United Nations that Israel’s military was “no done yet.” “Intense negotiations have been going on for four days, and will continue for as long as necessary,” Trump added. Hours earlier, as he left the White House to cheer on the American Ryder Cup golf team, Trump told reporters: “It’s looking like we have a deal on Gaza.” “I think it’s a deal that will get the hostages back, it’s going to be a deal that will end the war,” he added. “It’s going to be peace. I think we have a deal.” By nightfall in Washington however, Trump had retreated to merely claiming that there was “Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done”. Local TV conglomerate Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar Media Group said their ABC-affiliate stations will start airing Jimmy Kimmy Live! again on Friday night, ending their preempting of the show. Sinclair and fellow station owner Nexstar had continued to preempt Kimmel’s late-night talkshow even after ABC had put Kimmel back on air. Together, Sinclair and Nexstar’s preemption of the show left about 25% of TV viewers in the US unable to watch it, with the two companies owning 70 ABC-affiliate stations combined. After a frustrating morning of watching American golfers lose three of the first four Ryder Cup matches to their European rivals, Donald Trump got back to work on Friday, by posting a lengthy screed on social media in which he demanded that Microsoft fire its head of global affairs, Lisa Monaco. Monaco is the former deputy attorney general who oversaw the justice department’s investigation into Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot. In March, Trump signed an executive order rescinding Monaco’s security clearance, along with those of Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney and others. In his social media post, Trump wrote that it was shocking that Monaco, who was Barack Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser before later becoming Merrick Garland’s second in command at the justice department during the Biden administration, had been hired for “a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information”. “Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand,” the president added. “She is a menace to US National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government.” “It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco,” Trump concluded. The US supreme court on Friday extended an order that permits the Trump administration to not spend more than $4bn in congressionally appropriated foreign aid money that it is seeking to cancel. The unsigned order from the court’s conservative majority, over the objections of the court’s three liberals, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, lifted a lower court’s order that the administration was obliged to spend funds appropriated by Congress. Late last month, Trump informed the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, that he would not spend $4.9bn in foreign aid that Congress had previously approved, decrying it as “woke, weaponized and wasteful spending”. The money was to go to United Nations organizations and peacekeeping operations, as well as development assistance and democracy-promotion projects. The court’s majority wrote that Trump’s authority over foreign affairs weighed heavily in its decision, while cautioning that it was not making a final ruling in the case. “The effect is to prevent the funds from reaching their intended recipients — not just now but (because of their impending expiration) for all time,” Kagan wrote in her dissent, joined by Sotomayor and Jackson. “Because that result conflicts with the separation of powers, I respectfully dissent.” I’ve just spoken with Glenn Ivey, the Maryland Democratic congressman, who took part in the House Democrats’ virtual caucus meeting today. He noted that lawmakers were “resolute” on the call, but ultimately since both sides are “dug in” he expects a government shutdown next week. However, Ivey said that he finds it “hard to see” how Democrats get blamed for it. “What are the Democrats doing that they’re going to see as obstructing?” he said. “It’s holding out for healthcare … We’re trying to keep grandma in the nursing home, keep your monthly payments from tripling in January. I mean, they’re really going to be mad at us for that?” Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have said, repeatedly, that since Democrats aren’t budging on accepting the GOP’s “clean” continuing resolution, they would be responsible for government shutdown at the end of September. Currently, the Republican-written bill is languishing in the Senate, and the House speaker, Mike Johnson, has vowed to not call the lower chamber back until after funding lapses in just a few days. After the office of management and budget sent out a memo this week to federal agencies, telling them to brace for more layoffs in the event of a government shutdown, Ivey (whose district borders Washington DC and includes many federal workers) said that many of his constituents have already felt the impact of reductions in force since Trump returned to the White House. “[The administration] has done everything they can to get rid of as many federal employees as possible,” Ivey said. “So they’re not, they’re not really seeing how things would be different.” Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat who just won a special election to replace her late father, Raúl Grijalva, in Congress, suggested on Thursday that her swearing-in might be delayed by Republican House leaders because she has promised to sign a discharge petition calling for the release of files on the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender who socialized with Donald Trump for over a decade. Grijalva told the MeidasTouch Network, a liberal podcast, that she intends to be in Washington on Monday but has been told that she will have to wait for official results to be certified before being sworn in. She noted that this is a departure from procedure, as just a few weeks ago another Democrat, James Walkinshaw, was sworn in the day after his election. Two Republicans who won special elections earlier this year were also sworn in the day after their victories. “Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I’m number 218,” Grijalva said, meaning that her signature on the discharge petition would mean that a majority of the House backed the measure to compel the justice department to release all of the Epstein files, against the wishes of the president. Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee sent a letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, today, accusing the justice department of being weaponized by Donald Trump. They cite recent examples, including Thursday’s indictment of James Comey, and the president’s move to force out Erik Siebert from his role as the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia and replace him with a White House staffer and Trump ally. “Our justice system operates on the principle that the president cannot demand the prosecution of an individual to settle personal scores, let alone when there is no credible evidence that a person engaged in any wrongdoing,” the lawmakers wrote. The senators, led by the committee’s ranking member, Dick Durbin, are demanding that the Department of Justice provide documentation into several ongoing investigations, and interviews with several officials, including Ed Martin – a Trump loyalist who is now in charge of the DoJ group investigating the “weaponization” of the justice system. Democrats on the House oversight committee have released a tranche of partial records from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, which include flight logs, diary appointments and a financial ledger. In the partially redacted documents, there are several emailed schedules over the years, which include: A 2019 breakfast with former White House adviser Steve Bannon. Lunch in 2017 with billionaire and Trump ally Peter Thiel. A potential visit from Elon Musk to Epstein’s island in 2014. There is also a flight log from 2000, which lists Prince Andrew as a passenger on Epstein’s private plane. “It should be clear to every American that Jeffrey Epstein was friends with some of the most powerful and wealthiest men in the world,” said oversight spokesperson Sara Guerrero. “Every new document produced provides new information as we work to bring justice for the survivors and victims. Oversight Democrats will not stop until we identify everyone complicit in Epstein’s heinous crimes.” However, the committee’s Republican leadership said the records were “old news”, and that the members in the minority were “conveniently withholding documents that contain the names of Democratic officials”. “Once again they are putting politics over victims,” Republicans said. “We are releasing them all soon.” Nineteen people detained at an immigration detention center that the Trump administration opened within Louisiana’s infamous Angola prison were entering their fifth day on hunger strike on Sunday, according to advocacy groups. Those striking at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) processing center set up at Angola’s former Camp J are demanding access to medical and mental health care – including prescription medications, according to the Southeast Dignity Not Detention Coalition (SEDND) and the National Immigration Project (NIPNLG). A statement from both groups says that detainees at the facility the Trump administration has dubbed “the Louisiana Lockup” are also asking for basic necessities such as toilet paper, hygiene products and clean drinking water. Further, they seek visitation from Ice officers to raise concerns about conditions inside the facility. People with chronic health conditions are not receiving prescribed medications, according to the SEDND and NIPNLG statement, and there is no access to services such as a law library or religious programming, which are required under federal detention standards. Angola’s official name is the Louisiana state penitentiary. The strike there comes after Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, declared a state emergency in July to address what he said is a lack of capacity to house offenders at the prison. Sinclair – the company which owns more than 35 ABC affiliates– said today that it will “end its preemption of Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and the show will return tonight across its stations. This comes after several lawmakers criticized Sinclair for deciding to keep the late-night show off the air, despite Disney’s decision to end the suspension earlier this week, following Kimmel’s criticism of the Trump administration in the wake of the Charlie Kirk shooting. In a statement the broadcast conglomerate said: Over the last week, we have received thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers, and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives. We have also witnessed troubling acts of violence, including the despicable incident of a shooting at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento. These events underscore why responsible broadcasting matters and why respectful dialogue between differing voices remains so important. According to Reuters, Sinclair’s ABC stations represent about 14% of US households. Another ABC station owner, Nextstar Media Group, has kept Jimmy Kimmel’s show off the air – after Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr put pressure on ABC affiliates to suspend the show or risk losing their broadcast licenses. In a quick press conference today on Capitol Hill, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, scolded the president for his trip to New York today. “Donald Trump, get back to Washington DC. Why are you at a golf event right now and the government is four days away from closing?” the congressman said. “That’s outrageous. And it speaks to the fact that these extremists could care less about the health, safety and economic wellbeing of the American people. They’re on vacation right now.” Fewer than 24 hours after the indictment of James Comey, the president said that he hopes “more” political adversaries will be prosecuted. Speaking to reporters before he left DC to attend the Ryder Cup in New York, Trump maintained that the former FBI director’s prosecution was “about justice … not about revenge”. The president kicked off the day with Truth Social posts that called Comey “a dirty cop” and “destroyer of lives”. Meanwhile, Democrats and legal experts say the indictment is latest sign Trump is turning the justice system into weapon to silence critics, as my colleague Chris Stein reports. Trump also continued to blame Democrats for a looming government shutdown. A reminder that lawmakers have yet to pass a resolution to keep the government funded beyond 30 September. Today, the president held up his side of the blame game, telling reporters: “These people are crazy, the Democrats. So if it has to shut down, it’ll have to shut down, but they’re the ones that are shutting down.” For their part, House Democrats will meet virtually today for a caucus meeting, as they refuse to back any funding bill without several healthcare provisions. Democrats on the House judiciary committee are asking its Republican leader to allow victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his associates to testify about “the institutional failures that enabled these horrific crimes”. The letter, signed by 17 Democrats and led by ranking member Jamie Raskin and congresswoman Deborah Ross, a leader in the Democratic Women’s caucus and longtime champion of sexual violence survivors, comes amid continued pressure for the Trump administration to authorize the release of more files related to the disgraced financier. Congressman Raskin said that the indictment of James Comey is because the justice department is in “full cover-up mode” over the Epstein files. In an interview with CNN, the Democrat from Maryland called the prosecution an example of the “complete politicization of the Department of Justice”. He added: “We’re in the midst of trying to get this information with apparently real crimes. And we’ve got a strong, bipartisan majority saying, ‘Stop the cover-up of the Epstein files. Just go ahead and release them.’” An federal immigration officer has been “relieved of his duties” after a video showing him pushing a woman to the floor at an immigration court in New York City spread quickly on social media. Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said that the agent’s actions were “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of Ice”. McLaughlin added that the officer is “being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation”. An Arizona Republican state representative who has expressed support for January 6 insurrectionists on Wednesday called for a Democratic congresswoman to be executed, as a response to a video clip. The comment on X by state representative John Gillette of Kingman, Arizona, first reported by the Arizona Mirror, was a reaction to a short clip drawn from a YouTube video in March by US representative Pramila Jayapal, a longtime Democratic congresswoman representing Washington state, titled The Resistance Lab. In the video, Jayapal discusses preparations for street protests against the Trump administration. “Until people like this, that advocate for the overthrow of the American government are tried, convicted and hanged … it will continue,” he posted. Nothing in either the clip or the longer video actually suggests Jayapal is advocating for the overthrow of the US government. The video carries explicit calls for non-violent protest and discussed with alarm a rise in political violence in the US. Gillette’s comment is a continuation of a string of inflammatory far-right online invective by the Mohave county Republican and retired army reserve command sergeant major. Gillette has defended January 6 protesters, who were intent on violently overturning Trump’s defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, as “political prisoners” and described Muslims as “terrorists”. It also reflects a widening call among Republicans to criminalize protest and speech critical of the Trump administration. Gillette has not yet responded to a request from the Guardian for comment. An federal immigration officer has been “relieved of his duties” after a video showing him pushing a woman to the floor at an immigration court in New York City spread quickly on social media. Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said that the agent’s actions were “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of Ice”. “This officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,” McLaughlin added. The video shows a woman, and a young girl who appears to be her daughter, pleading to officers to not take away her husband at 26 Federal Plaza. In the video, they are crying as officers take him into custody. ProPublica identified the woman as Monica Moreta-Galarza, from Ecuador. The video captures Moreta-Galarza pleading with the now-suspended officer. He tries to dismiss her by saying “adios”. When Moreta-Galarza touches his shoulder, he grabs her, pushes her across the hallway, against the wall, and on to the floor. After the incident, Democratic congressman Dan Goldman, of New York, said that Moreta-Galarza “fled” to his office with her two young children. ProPublica also reported that Moreta-Galarza was later taken to hospital after being pushed to the ground. Ahead of House Democrats’ meeting today, as a government shutdown looms, Donald Trump continued to blame lawmakers across the aisle for any lapse in government funding earlier today. “These people are crazy, the Democrats. So if it has to shut down, it’ll have to shut down, but they’re the ones that are shutting down,” the president said. A reminder that Congress is in recess this week, and only the Senate is set to return on Monday – before funding expires at midnight on 30 September. A continuing resolution to keep the government open stalled in the upper chamber last week. Per my colleague Chris Stein’s reporting earlier, that Democrats on the House judiciary committee are calling Republican leadership to allow survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse to testify, congressman Jamie Raskin – the committee’s ranking member – said that the indictment of James Comey is because the justice department is in “full cover-up mode”. “They’re doing the bidding of President Trump with respect to Mr Comey, they’re doing the bidding of President Trump with respect to covering up cases,” Raskin said in an interview with CNN News Central. He added: What we see is the complete politicization of the Department of Justice. But we’re in the midst of trying to get this information with apparently real crimes. And we’ve got a strong, bipartisan majority saying, ‘Stop the cover-up of the Epstein files. Just go ahead and release them.’” For Donald Trump, the indictment of former FBI director and longtime foe James Comey was “justice in America”. Legal observers and lawmakers see something far more troubling. A former Republican appointed to lead the bureau by Barack Obama and kept on by Trump until he was fired in 2017, Comey was indicted Thursday on charges related to allegedly lying to Congress five years ago during a hearing on the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. The charges were filed in the eastern district of Virginia only after Erik Siebert was forced out as US attorney for reportedly finding no grounds to indict Comey. The justice department replaced him with Trump loyalist with little prosecutorial experience, Lindsey Halligan, and shortly after, a grand jury indicted Comey on one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The indictment is the latest sign that the president is making good on his promise “to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics”, said Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. “This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power. Our system depends on prosecutors making decisions based on evidence and the law, not on the personal grudges of a politician determined to settle scores,” Warner said. Democratic senator Adam Schiff, a former federal prosecutor who played a lead role in Trump’s first impeachment, said on X he had “never witnessed such a blatant abuse of the” justice department, calling it “little more than an arm of the president’s retribution campaign”. Mike Zamore, national director of policy and government affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union, said Trump “has yet again proven his disdain for the principles that have actually made America great”. Read the rest of Chris’s piece here: Bryan Graham at Bethpage Black Donald Trump’s arrival dominated the opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, about 37 miles south-east of Manhattan, where fans had begun lining up outside the gates as early as 3am. Helicopters circled constantly overhead, while spectators navigated TSA-style checkpoints and Secret Service patrols around the main grandstand. Shortly after 11am, Air Force One made a low, close flyover of the grounds as it approached Farmingdale, drawing gasps from the crowd and reminding everyone of the president’s imminent appearance. Officials had urged spectators to budget extra time, wary of the sort of disruption seen at the US Open tennis tournament earlier this month, when Trump’s visit delayed entry and thousands of spectators missed the start of the men’s final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. At Bethpage, Trump’s presence was no less inescapable. The early carnival atmosphere – fans chanting “U-S-A” as the American pair of Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas won the opening hole – quickly dulled as Europe seized control. By midday, the sport itself had receded. What lingered was the sound of choppers, the roar of Air Force One overhead, and the heavy security presence behind the 18th green and near the first tee that turned golf’s biennial matchplay carnival into a backdrop for presidential theatre. Responding to James Comey’s indictment last night, Matthew Miller, who was the director of public affairs at the justice department during the Obama administration, wrote on X: The Justice Department we have long known is dead. As in many authoritarian states, it now exists as an arm of the government to punish the president’s enemies, regardless of the law. A tragedy for the country with lasting implications, even if this case is dismissed. The chair of the House select committee on China has said he will conduct full oversight over a deal for Chinese-based ByteDance to sell the US assets of TikTok that was approved by Donald Trump under a 2024 law. “The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,” said the Republican representative John Moolenaar. He said he would host the leadership of the new TikTok entity at a hearing next year. Immigrants with no criminal record are now the largest group in US immigration detention, according to data released by the government. The number of people with no criminal history arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and detained by the Trump administration has now surpassed the number of those charged with crimes. Ice, the federal agency most heavily relied upon by Donald Trump to carry out his mass deportation campaign, released its latest numbers on Thursday. According to the official data, 16,523 people in immigration detention with no criminal record were arrested by Ice, compared with 15,725 who do have a criminal record and 13,767 with pending criminal charges. There are now a total of 59,762 people in Ice detention across the US. The remaining number of people in Ice custody were brought in by border officials. The numbers released by Ice mark the first time under the second Trump administration that the total number of immigrants with no criminal history in detention has surpassed that of people convicted of a crime or with pending charges. The agency’s data also contradicts Trump administration officials’ repeated narrative that the chief focus of the White House’s agenda and the Department of Homeland Security dragnet is dangerous criminals. Read my full report with Will Craft below. James Comey’s son-in-law, Troy Edwards, has resigned as a federal prosecutor for the eastern district of Virginia, following his father-in-law’s indictment. According to his resignation letter, seen by multiple outlets, Edwards sent his resignation notice to Lindsey Halligan – the newly minted US attorney for the district – and wrote that he was quitting “to uphold my oath to the constitution and the country”. A reminder that Halligan was appointed after Trump fired her predecessor, Erik Siebert, after Siebert said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Comey and other Trump adversaries. Edwards was on the team of attorneys who charged participants in the January 6 attack on the US capitol. Democrats on the House judiciary committee are asking its Republican leader to allow victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his associates to testify about “the institutional failures that enabled these horrific crimes”. The letter, signed by 17 Democrats and led by ranking member Jamie Raskin and congresswoman Deborah Ross, a leader in the Democratic Women’s caucus and longtime champion of sexual violence survivors, comes amid continued pressure for the Trump administration to authorize the release of more files related to the disgraced financier. “The release of Justice Department files related to the sex trafficking ring led by Mr Epstein, while necessary, is not a substitute for the voices of these survivors,” the letter reads. “The House Judiciary Committee has an important role to play in addressing the institutional failures that enabled these horrific crimes and failed to protect the women and girls he trafficked and abused.” Testimony by the survivors – some of whom appeared at a press conference outside the US Capitol earlier this month – “will help Congress to better understand the systemic breakdowns and shortcomings that enabled Mr Epstein’s network to operate for so long, including potential gaps in law enforcement practices, prosecutorial discretion, victim protection protocols, reporting requirements, and institutional oversight.” A spokesperson for the committee’s Republican chair, Jim Jordan, did not respond to a request for comment. The demand comes as a petition to force a vote in the House on legislation to release the Epstein files draws near to receiving the 218th signature necessary for its success, after Democrat Adelita Grijalva won a special election for a vacant seat earlier this week. Earlier, on the south lawn of the White House, Donald Trump took a few questions from reporters. “It’s about justice, it’s not about revenge,” the president said with regard to James Comey’s indictment. “He didn’t think he’d be caught, and he got caught,” Trump said, referring to the former FBI director he fired in 2017. “He lied. He lied a lot.” The president also said that he hopes “there will be others” who are prosecuted. Without giving much detail, the president also said that he “thinks we have a deal with Gaza”. “I think it’s a deal that will get the hostages back. It’s going to be a deal that will end the war,” he said. “That’ll be number eight,” he added, referring to his misleading list of conflicts that he’s resolved since he returned to the White House. The president has just left DC to attend the Ryder Cup tournament in New York. He didn’t stop for questions as he boarded the plane. Barbara McQuade, former US attorney for the eastern district of Michigan, made a key point on social media today about the grounds for a Comey conviction. She notes that while “probable cause is legally sufficient” in order to obtain an indictment, the justice department policy requires enough evidence to “obtain and sustain a conviction”. “That means proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” she adds. Right now, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is speaking at the United Nations general assembly in New York. According to my colleague Amy Sedghi, before he started speaking, dozens of delegates in the hall walked out. There were boos and cheers. Netanyahu just thanked Donald Trump for his “his bold, decisive action against Iran” earlier this year. As a reminder, that you can follow the latest developments at our dedicated liveblog below. Donald Trump’s long public campaign to get someone in his administration to bring criminal charges against James Comey, the former FBI director he fired in 2017, finally succeeded on Thursday. But the president has been so public about his loathing of the indicted man, and his desire to see him jailed, that it might be hard for prosecutors to convince a jury that the case was not brought for political reasons. Comey was fired by Trump in 2017 after he reportedly refused a request to pledge his loyalty to the newly elected president, and then publicly confirmed to Congress that the FBI was conducting a counterintelligence investigation of Russian efforts to help Trump get elected in 2016. Trump’s firing of Comey backfired, however, because it helped convince then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel, former FBI director Robert Mueller, to, in his words, “oversee the previously confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters”. Although Mueller’s report, issued in 2019, concluded that his team “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities”, the investigation unearthed evidence that a Russian effort did take place and, in Mueller’s words, “established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome”. Mueller added that the Trump campaign “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts”. The indictment of Comey comes as Trump seeks to use the power of the justice department to punish a man he sees as a central figure in the Russia investigation he has continually described as “a witch-hunt” and “a hoax”. The House Democratic caucus will meet virtually today at 2pm EST, ahead of a looming government shutdown just five days away. Congressional Democrats have so far been united in their push-back on the Republican-written resolution to extend government funding until 21 November. For the president’s part, he cancelled a meeting with Democratic leadership that was scheduled for this week. Democrats have also called the memo by the office of management and budget (OMB) – which told federal agencies to prepare for a reduction in force in the event of a shutdown – an intimidation tactic. The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, called Russ Vought, the director of the OMB, a “malignant political hack” earlier this week, and told him to “get lost”. “We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,” Jeffries added. In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that the indictment of former FBI director James Comey “represents a grotesque abuse of presidential power”. “By firing his previously appointed U.S. Attorney and installing someone who would do his bidding and bring criminal charges at his direction. President Trump has yet again proven his disdain for the principles that have actually made America great,” said Mike Zamore, the ACLU’s national director of policy and government affairs. “The president and his administration have corrupted our system of justice to turn his campaign of retribution into reality.” Donald Trump will leave the White House at about 9:50am EST to attend the Ryder Cup golf tournament in Bethpage, New York. We’ll keep an eye out for the president if he speaks to reporters en route. He’ll spend the day at the competition before heading back to DC at 3:30pm EST. President Donald Trump insisted South Korea will provide billions of dollars in investments “upfront”, despite Seoul’s assertion that it would suffer a financial crisis if it meets the US demands without safeguards. In July, South Korea pledged $350bn toward US projects, but has balked at US demands for control over the funds and South Korean officials say talks to formalise their trade deal are at a deadlock. Earlier this month, Trump formalised a trade deal with Japan, lowering tariffs on Japanese automobile imports and other products in return for $550bn of Japanese investment in US projects, and US officials have pressed Seoul to follow suit. “We have in Japan it’s $550bn, South Korea’s $350bn. That’s upfront,” Trump told reporters on Thursday in the Oval Office as he touted the amount of money he said his sweeping tariffs have brought in. South Korea, however, says it cannot afford to structure its investments in the same way as Japan, and president Lee Jae Myung told Reuters last week that without safeguards such as a currency swap, South Korea’s economy could be plunged into crisis. Well, the president is awake. Donald Trump has posted the following on his Truth Social social media network: JAMES COMEY IS A DIRTY COP. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! That outburst came shortly a more detailed post in which he called former FBI director James Comey “corrupt\". Trump wrote: Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can’t imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED! It is not a complex lie, it’s a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been, but he was just assigned a Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge, so he’s off to a very good start. Nevertheless, words are words, and he wasn’t hedging or in dispute. He was very positive, there was no doubt in his mind about what he said, or meant by saying it. He left himself ZERO margin of error on a big and important answer to a question. He just got unexpectedly caught. James “Dirty Cop” Comey was a destroyer of lives. He knew exactly what he was saying, and that it was a very serious and far reaching lie for which a very big price must be paid! President DJT Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said he and President Donald Trump had made “meaningful progress” on a range of regional and bilateral issues at their first meeting in the White House in six years, where they discussed defence cooperation and trade. Trump told reporters after Thursday’s meeting with Erdogan that he believed Nato member Turkey would agree to his request to stop purchasing Russian oil and said that he may lift US sanctions on Ankara so it can buy advanced American F-35 jets, Reuters reported. In comments to reporters on his flight home from Washington, Erdogan said the two leaders had exchanged views on steps to boost trade, including the revision of customs duties to achieve their target of $100bn trade volume. “It’s certainly impossible to resolve every issue in a single meeting. However, this meeting has led to meaningful progress on many issues,” Erdogan said, according to a transcript of his comments shared by his office on Friday. Erdogan added that he had left the meeting with Trump “happy”. A group of Disney investors is asking the company to turn over documents related to the company’s decision to temporarily suspend Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show, amid charges the media company may have been “complicit in succumbing” to media censorship. The investors, composed of lawyers for the American Federation of Teachers and Reporters Without Borders, noted that Disney’s stock “suffered significant declines in response to the company’s abrupt decision to suspend Mr. Kimmel and his show”, it said in a letter to Disney. “The fallout from suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! sparked criticism as an attack on free speech, triggered boycotts and union support for Mr. Kimmel, and caused Disney’s stock to plummet amid fears of brand damage and concerns that Disney was complicit in succumbing to the government overreach and media censorship,” the letter said. The lawyers are demanding “copies of any meeting minutes, meeting agenda and written materials provided to the [company’s] board or presented at any meeting of the board” regarding Kimmel’s decision. It cites a law in Delaware, where Disney is incorporated, that says shareholders can receive materials around board discussion “to investigate potential wrongdoing, mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty by members [of the board]”. Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday outlining the terms of a deal to transfer TikTok to a US owner. Trump said he and China’s president Xi Jinping had come to an agreement to allow TikTok to continue operating in the US, separating the social media platform from its Chinese owner ByteDance. Trump said the deal complies with a law that would have forced the shutdown of the app for American users had it not been divested and sold to a US owner. “I spoke with President Xi and he said, ‘Go ahead with it,’” Trump said at a press conference. “This is going to be American-operated all the way.” Under the plan, US investors will take over the majority of TikTok’s operations and take charge of a licensed copy of the app’s powerful recommendation algorithm. American companies are expected to own about 65% of the US version of the spun-off company, while ByteDance and Chinese investors will own less than 20%. The new version of TikTok will be controlled by a seven-member board of directors made up of cybersecurity and national security experts, six of them Americans, according to the White House. The new US company will be valued at $14bn, according to JD Vance, who also spoke at the press conference, a number far lower than the valuation for ByteDance overall, which is estimated to be around $330bn. By comparison, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, is valued at $1.8tn. The group of American TikTok investors is led by the US software giant Oracle, which will oversee TikTok’s US operations, provide cloud service for user data storage and get a license to take control of the app’s algorithm. White House officials have said ByteDance and Chinese officials will not have access to US user data. The Open Society Foundations (OSF), the major philanthropic group funded by George Soros, has criticized the Trump administration for “politically motivated attacks on civil society” after a report that the justice department had instructed federal prosecutors to come up with plans to investigate the charity. The New York Times reported on Thursday that a lawyer in the office of Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, sent a memo to several federal prosecutors in attorney’s offices in California, New York, Washington DC, Chicago and Detroit, offering a range of charges to consider against the group. Those charges included racketeering, arson, wire fraud and material support for terrorism, the newspaper reported. The push comes as Trump has ramped up efforts to deploy the justice department to target his enemies. He has pledged to crack down on leftwing groups in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing and has repeatedly singled out Soros, a major funder of liberal groups, as a target. “We’re going to look into Soros, because I think it’s a Rico case against him and other people,” Trump said on 12 September, using an acronym to refer to racketeering charges. “Because this is more than like protests. This is real agitation.” In a statement, the OSF described the effort as “meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with and undermine the first amendment right to free speech”. “The Open Society Foundations unequivocally condemn terrorism and do not fund terrorism. Our activities are peaceful and lawful, and our grantees are expected to abide by human rights principles and comply with the law,” it said in a statement. Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook urged the US supreme court on Thursday to reject Donald Trump’s attempt to fire her, telling the justices the Republican president’s unprecedented move would destroy the central bank’s independence and disrupt financial markets. Lawyers for Cook filed a written response opposing the justice department’s 18 September emergency request to lift a federal judge’s order that blocked Trump from immediately removing Cook, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden, while her legal challenge continues. Granting Trump’s request, her lawyers told the supreme court, “would dramatically alter the status quo, ignore centuries of history and transform the Federal Reserve into a body subservient to the president’s will”. Washington-based US district judge Jia Cobb ruled on 9 September that Trump’s claims that Cook committed mortgage fraud before taking office – allegations that Cook denies – likely were not sufficient grounds for removal under the 1913 law that created the Fed. The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit in a 2-1 ruling on 15 September denied the administration’s request to put Cobb’s order on hold, ruling that Cook likely was denied due process in violation of the US constitution’s fifth amendment. In Thursday’s filing, Cook’s lawyers said the Fed’s “unique history of independence” has helped make the US economy the strongest in the world. Siding with Trump, they wrote, “would signal to the financial markets that the Federal Reserve no longer enjoys its traditional independence, risking chaos and disruption”. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, sued Trump in August after the president announced he would remove her. Cook has said the claims made by Trump against her did not give him the legal authority to remove her and were a pretext to fire her for her monetary policy stance. The White House is telling federal agencies to prepare large-scale firings of workers if the government shuts down next week in a partisan fight over spending plans – prompting the Democrats to accuse Donald Trump of intimidation tactics. In a memo released on Wednesday night, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said agencies should consider a reduction in force for federal programs whose funding would lapse next week, is not otherwise funded and is “not consistent with the president’s priorities”. That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once the US Congress approved a new financial plan. A mass firing would eliminate employees positions, which would trigger yet another massive upheaval in a federal workforce that has already faced major rounds of cuts this year, leading with the dramatic intervention by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) early in the second Trump administration. When asked by reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon about the possibility of a government shutdown, Trump said: “Could be, yeah, because the Democrats are crazed. They don’t know what they’re doing.” Asked whether he would agree to a request from Democrats for an extension of subsidies for the costs of healthcare plans under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, on which millions of Americans depend for health insurance – which has become the sticking point in negotiations over the government funding bill – Trump simply repeated his false claim that Democrats are insisting on funding “to give the money to illegal aliens”. Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum on Thursday aimed at reining in what he has called a radical leftwing domestic “terror network” but which seemed likely to meet fierce legal pushback from critics depicting it as a licence for a broad crackdown on his political opponents. Prompted by journalists, Trump suggested that George Soros, the billionaire Hungarian-born philanthropist who funds the Open Society Foundations, could be in his sights. He also identified Reid Hoffman, a billionaire venture capitalist, adding: “I hear about him. Maybe it could be him. It could be a lot of people.” Earlier, the Open Society Foundations had hit back at reports that the justice department was planning to target the group and criticized the Trump administration for “politically motivated attacks on civil society”. Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a statement: “After one of the most harrowing weeks for our first amendment rights, the president is invoking political violence, which we all condemn, as an excuse to target non-profits and activists with the false and stigmatizing label of ‘domestic terrorism’. This is a shameful and dangerous move.” At a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, the memorandum was presented as aimed at “establishing a comprehensive strategy to investigate, disrupt and dismantle all stages of organized political violence and domestic terrorism”. It was said to be part of an administration-wide response that would include the FBI’s joint terrorism taskforces, the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury. Donald Trump on Thursday announced a new round of punishing tariffs, saying the United States will impose a 100% tariffs on imported branded drugs, 25% tariff on imports of all heavy-duty trucks and 50% tariffs on kitchen cabinets. The US president also said he would start charging a 50% tariff on bathroom vanities and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture next week, with all the new duties to take effect from 1 October. Drug companies warned earlier this year that Americans would suffer the most if Trump decided to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals. In 2024, the US imported nearly $233bn in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shock waves to voters as healthcare expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase. Pascal Chan, vice-president for strategic policy and supply chains at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that the tariffs could harm Americans’ health with “immediate price hikes, strained insurance systems, hospital shortages, and the real risk of patients rationing or foregoing essential medicines”. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with the news that James Comey, the former FBI director and one of Donald Trump’s most frequent targets, was indicted on Thursday on one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding, the latest move in the president’s retribution campaign against his political adversaries. The indictment, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, shows Comey’s charges centred on whether he lied and misled lawmakers during testimony in September 2020 about the Russia investigation. Comey was expected to surrender and have his initial appearance in federal district court on Friday morning, according to a person familiar with the matter. Comey is expected to be represented by Patrick Fitzgerald, a former US attorney for the northern district of Illinois. While the precise details were not clear in the sparse, two-page indictment, it appeared to reference Comey’s testimony that he had never authorized someone at the FBI to leak to the news media about the Trump or Hillary Clinton investigations – a claim prosecutors alleged was false. “No one is above the law. Today’s indictment reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people,” Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, said in a statement on Thursday. The indictment followed Trump’s instruction to Bondi to “move now” to prosecute Comey and other officials he considers political foes, in an impatient and extraordinarily direct social media post trampling on the justice department’s tradition of independence. It also came less than a week after Lindsey Halligan was installed as the top federal prosecutor in the eastern district of Virginia, after Trump fired her predecessor, Erik Siebert, after he declined to bring charges against Comey over concerns there was insufficient evidence. Halligan, most recently a White House aide and former Trump lawyer who has no prosecutorial experience, was also presented with a memo earlier this week laying out why charges should not be brought. But the justice department still pushed it through, people familiar with the matter said. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the US senate intelligence committee, said: Donald Trump has made clear that he intends to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics. Responding to the indictment, hours after it was filed, Comey said in a video statement posted on Instagram that he was innocent and welcomed a trial. “My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn’t imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn’t either,” Comey said. Read the full story here: In other developments: Authorities said on Thursday that the words of the suspect in the shooting on Wednesday at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in Texas were “definitively anti-Ice” but said that they did not find evidence that the suspect was a member of “any specific group or entity, nor did he mention any specific government agency other than Ice”.

A Microsoft survey of nearly 1,500 UK senior leaders across public and private sectors, as well as 1,440 employees, found that more than half of executives feel their organisation has no official AI plan. Roughly the same proportion report a growing gap in productivity – a measure of economic efficiency – between employees who use AI and those who do not. “Some organisations appear to be stuck in neutral, caught in the experimentation phase, rather than in the deployment [of AI],” said Darren Hardman, the tech company’s UK chief executive. Microsoft, the biggest financial backer of the ChatGPT developer, OpenAI, has been pushing AI’s deployment in the workplace through autonomous AI agents – tools that can carry out tasks without human intervention. Early adopters of Microsoft’s Copilot Studio product, which deploys bots, include the blue-chip consulting firm McKinsey, which is using agents to carry out tasks such as scheduling meetings with prospective clients. The Tony Blair Institute, a thinktank, has estimated AI could displace up to 3m jobs in the UK, although it expects the net loss to be in the low hundreds of thousands as the technology creates new roles. Speaking to the Guardian, Hardman said AI agents would remove the “digital drudgery” of people’s jobs and allow them to focus on the “creative aspects” of their jobs, potentially creating new roles as the first wave of the internet did for the retail sector. Referring to the creation of new roles in retail such as data analysts, web designers and social media managers, he said: “The nature of that industry changed with the onset of the internet. And I think the creation of an agentic workplace is going to do the same.” Hardman said proposed reforms to UK copyright law, which are fiercely opposed by Britain’s creative industries, would provide “wider economic growth for the UK”. He said: “We think it’s going to provide clarity. We think it’s going to support AI development.” The UK government is proposing to allow tech companies such as Microsoft to use copyright-protected work without permission in order to train their models. Critics of the proposals have described them as a “wholesale” transfer of wealth from the creative industries to the tech sector. Separately, the former chief executive of BP Bernard Looney has been appointed the chair of the UK technology startup ExpectAI. Looney left the oil and gas company in 2023 after admitting he had failed to fully disclose a series of personal relationships with his colleagues to the board. He has been appointed to help accelerate the expansion of ExpectAI, which uses data to help small and medium-sized businesses cut costs and reduce emissions.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft", "companies": ["Microsoft"]}

The analysis, conducted on behalf of the Greens, found in 2022-23 Google made $8.7bn across advertising and cloud services, Microsoft made $2.9bn, Meta made $1.3bn and Amazon made close to $6bn across its range of services. Under the Greens’ policy proposal, revenue in excess of $20m earned from digital services in Australia would be taxed at a rate of 3%. The platforms would need to be making more than €750m in worldwide revenue to be captured by the policy. The medium-term revenue for the government under this proposal would be $11.5bn, the costing suggested. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The Greens senator and communications spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the funds could be used pay for essential public services such as dental in Medicare and cost-of-living relief. “We know this works overseas and it can work here,” she said. “At least 12 other countries already have a digital services tax including the UK, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, Austria [and] Portugal.” A major hurdle for any proposed tax on US tech companies, however, will be the Trump administration. Last month, Trump quietly released a memorandum to the US Treasury secretary about “defending American companies and innovators from overseas extortion and unfair fines and penalties”, which focuses on tech companies – and specifically named Australia. It warned that countries that “impose a fine, penalty, tax, or other burden that is discriminatory, disproportionate, or designed to transfer significant funds or intellectual property from American companies to the foreign government or the foreign government’s favored domestic entities” would face tariffs and other actions. “In recent years, the gross domestic product of the United States’ digital economy alone, driven by cutting-edge American technology companies, has been bigger than the entire economy of Australia, Canada, or most members of the European Union,” the order states. “Instead of empowering their own workers and economies, foreign governments have increasingly exerted extraterritorial authority over American companies, particularly in the technology sector, hindering these companies’ success and appropriating revenues that should contribute to our nation’s wellbeing, not theirs.” The announcement has already thrown a spanner in the works for the news media bargaining incentive – a tax designed to force social media companies to pay for news – and the Albanese government hasn’t given strong signals the policy will be in place before the election. Guardian Australia understands the opposition has yet to be briefed by the government on the news media bargaining incentive and has not yet settled on a position. In Senate estimates last week, the infrastructure deputy secretary, James Chisholm, said the department was aware of the memorandum and said: “We will continue to engage with the administration and with industry to ensure that our respective digital policies are meeting our objectives.” In regard to trade and tariff policies that could target Australia, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told estimates last week it had taken the former Liberal government “some time” to negotiate carve outs, and the current government would have “an even greater hill to climb” but said there was a “strong case to put to the US administration”. “We’re very conscious of the policies articulated by President Trump and his administration, and there are many avenues which are being utilised, some of which have been outlined today.”", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft", "companies": ["Microsoft", "Google"]}

Here is a breakdown of the announcements in the UK-US “tech prosperity deal”, spelling out what is explicitly new in them. Microsoft invests $30bn in UK Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, hailed the “single biggest announcement” in the pact and insisted it was not an empty promise. The $30bn (£22bn) sets out the company’s UK budget over the next four years and refers not just to artificial intelligence infrastructure but also “ongoing operations” across the UK. Microsoft said the number included $15bn in capital expenditure – such as on equipment, land and buildings – for AI and cloud services, areas where datacentres are key components. The other half will go on day-to-day operations such as research, sales and product development. As part of the package, the US company said it would back an already announced project, an AI datacentre in Loughton, Essex, by becoming a core customer of its owner, the UK-based AI infrastructure company Nscale. Smith had criticised the UK in 2023 as being “bad for business” after Microsoft’s takeover of the video games maker Activision was blocked – a move that was later unwound. He told reporters on Tuesday that Microsoft had been “encouraged” by steps taken by the governments of Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, with the latter helping on planning permission and energy access. “We have a more stable opportunity to accelerate investment in the UK,” Smith said. The £22bn is a significant chunk of the £31bn value the UK government placed on the pact, which also includes £5bn of expenditure from Google that the search company described as “additional investment over the next two years”. The Google figure includes capital expenditure, research and development, and related engineering, as well as work at the AI unit Google DeepMind. AI growth zone in north-east England The north-east will host an AI “growth zone”, an area that will receive special support in planning permission and energy provision for hosting AI infrastructure such as datacentres. The government said this could unlock more than 5,000 jobs and bring in £30bn in investment, although this is all hypothetical for now. One of the datacentre sites, Blyth in Northumberland, has already been announced and is receiving £10bn in financial commitment from the US investment firm Blackstone. The other site mentioned, at Cobalt Park in North Tyneside, features a new development: a domestic version of the US “Stargate” datacentre project championed by Trump. Nscale, OpenAI and Nvidia will develop a platform that will deploy OpenAI’s technology in the UK. The idea is that Stargate UK will help develop “sovereign” AI, where cutting-edge technology is developed and used in the UK’s interests. As part of the first phase of Stargate UK, OpenAI will use 8,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), the powerful computer chips that underpin AI tools such as ChatGPT. Cobalt Park will be one of several UK sites under the plan. Nvidia’s £11bn announcement Nvidia, the world’s biggest AI chipmaker, touted an £11bn injection into the UK economy as part of the pact, providing up to 120,000 of its powerful Blackwell GPUs to projects that will be built over the next couple of years in the UK. So, there is a degree of overlap with other announcements in the pact. Clarifying its investment on Wednesday, Nvidia said the £11bn referred to the total “end-to-end value” its partners were delivering, encompassing the chips they have bought from Nvidia, land and buildings involved in constructing the datacentres, and supercomputers that will house the GPUs. Nvidia, at $4tn the biggest company in the world’s biggest economy, is also investing £500m in Nscale. Other announcements CoreWeave, a US datacentre company, said it would invest a further £1.5bn in the UK including a site in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The US software company Salesforce is investing an additional $2bn in the UK, adding two years to a financial commitment to the UK that will now run to 2030. Nvidia will also invest an undisclosed amount in the UK’s AI startup scene. Tech-boss influx The pact, and Trump’s visit, is being accompanied by an entourage of US tech bosses, with the chief executives of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI travelling across the Atlantic to symbolically reinforce their ties to the US president. Since Trump has been in power, US tech leaders have lined up to express loyalty and support for him and this is another opportunity to do so – as well as to support the projection of US leadership in AI. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is also reportedly attending Wednesday’s state banquet. AI and energy The government claims that the US-UK agreement will “turbocharge” the UK’s low-carbon economy by encouraging the build-out of new nuclear power stations to power the datacentres and supercomputers that underpin the technology. Specifically, the tech pact is expected to bring forward multibillion-pound investments in new nuclear technologies, which would create thousands of jobs under a string of separate transatlantic agreements revealed earlier this week. These new pledges build on Starmer’s existing plan for a once-in-a-generation nuclear expansion that he revealed earlier this year alongside an open invitation to tech companies such as Google, Meta and Amazon to invest in AI datacentres in Britain, which could be powered by small modular reactors. Growing the UK’s low-carbon energy supplies is considered essential if it hopes to host the energy-hungry datacentres required for an AI industry while staying within its net zero carbon budgets. But it will need to add enough new low-carbon energy generation to match the needs of the datacentres, as well as the growing demand for electricity from the rest of the economy, if it hopes to avoid adding extra gas power to the energy system in the future. Many global tech companies, which are also under pressure to satisfy their own carbon-cutting commitments, are turning to nuclear power because reactors generate electricity at a steady rate, which mirrors the energy use of a datacentre. This summer, Meta signed a 20-year deal with a nuclear power station in Illinois, while Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy in the race for AI dominance. Still, the latest AI plans are likely to raise further questions over the UK’s under-pressure water supplies – which are needed to cool down some energy-intensive datacentres.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft", "companies": ["Microsoft"]}

The Surface Laptop 13in joins the current seventh-generation Laptop 13.8in and 15in that were launched in the summer last year. It sits at the bottom of the premium pile in price, costing from £899 (€1,099/$900/A$1,699), but above the Laptop Go 3, which is likely to be phased out. The new 13in model looks like a cross between the Laptop Go and its bigger siblings. It has a similar but smaller glossy LCD touchscreen, which isn’t quite as bright or crisp and has a slower 60Hz refresh rate, but still looks good for the size. The smooth aluminium deck holds a full-size keyboard that offers a quality typing experience few competitors manage. The generous trackpad is smooth and precise but of the older, hinged variety, instead of the better haptic models fitted to the larger Surface Laptop models and other premium competitors. It still works fine but is harder to click higher up on the pad. The speakers in the deck are great for the size and the 1080p webcam above the screen is solid, even if it lacks Microsoft’s Windows Hello facial recognition for logging into the machine. Specifications Screen: 13in LCD 1920 x 1280 (178 PPI) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8 core) RAM: 16GB Storage: 256 or 512GB Operating system: Windows 11 Home Camera: 1080P front-facing Connectivity: wifi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, USB-A, 2xUSB-C (3.2), headphones Dimensions: 285.7 x 214.1 x 15.6mm Weight: 1.2kg Snapdragon X Plus The Laptop 13in has Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon X Plus Arm chip with eight cores (versus 10 on the larger models). It won’t win any raw performance awards but it is roughly on a par with its Intel competition and plenty fast enough for a laptop of this size. It stays quiet unless really pushed and feels snappy in operation while managing to be efficient on battery for general use. It lasts a very good 14 hours of work using plenty of browser tabs, multiple chat apps, text editors and note-taking apps. That is almost twice as long as previous Intel-based Surface Laptops and much more on a par with Apple’s class-leading MacBook Air. Using it for more demanding tasks, such as large photo editing or other creative applications, cuts the battery life roughly in half for a still solid seven hours. The Surface has two USB-C (3.2) ports and a USB-A port, which is reasonably good for a machine of this size. But it lacks the more modern USB4/Thunderbolt and ditches Microsoft’s proprietary Surface Connect port, relying instead on USB-C for charging, which is no bad thing unless you already own a Surface Dock or similar accessory. Windows 11 on Arm The Surface runs Windows 11, which generally works well without any unnecessary trials and bits of software that frequently plague rivals. But Windows on Arm chips, such as the Surface’s Snapdragon models, still has a few compatibility problems not shared by the version running on the standard x86 chips from Intel or AMD. Apps that aren’t written for Arm systems have to be run through an emulation system, which works in the background but makes them much slower. Lighter-weight x86 apps, such as the note-taker Evernote, work OK but are noticeably slower than on Arm-native rivals. The majority of popular apps now have Arm versions, which fly along. That includes Google Drive, which until recently was incompatible with Windows on Arm. But there are enough apps with issues, particularly in the creative industries, that you should check for problems before buying. Gaming is also tricky, as most big games including Fortnite are not compatible with Arm chips. The laptop is a Copilot+PC and includes Microsoft’s various AI tools. The much-delayed Recall feature records snapshots of what you’re doing on the machine so you can use it like a time machine to see what was on screen at any particular moment. You can search Recall using natural language and interact with the text, images or data it finds, such as opening a site you were browsing a couple of days ago. It is an opt-in feature, the screenshots are stored locally on your device secured by your fingerprint, and you can block some apps from being captured, such as a password manager, but it could still be a privacy risk too far for some. The rest of the AI tools are similar to those on previous Surfaces, including a Cocreator system in Paint that can turn crude sketches into art. The most powerful tool is Copilot, which is integrated across multiple Microsoft apps, including Word and other members of the Office suite if you have a subscription. Generally it works as a cross between a search tool and an AI chatbot, and makes short work of turning data into tables, jazzing up your copy or identifying things from images, though you have to use Microsoft’s Edge browser for it to be able to see what you’re looking at on your screen. Microsoft’s new “Click to Do” feature allows you to hold the Windows button and click on something on your screen to perform actions with it, such as remove an image’s background with Paint or rewrite the text with AI. It is fairly basic at the moment, with more features to be added later this year, but it works as a much quicker and accessible way of performing AI tasks with things on a PC. Sustainability The laptop is generally repairable, with a replaceable SSD, spare parts, self-repair and service guides available. The machine contains recycled cobalt and rare earth metals. Microsoft operates trade-in and recycling schemes and publishes out-of-warranty repair costs and product environmental impact reports. Price The Microsoft Surface Laptop 13in costs from £899 (€1,099/$899.99/A$1,699) and ships on 10 June. For comparison, the Surface Laptop 13.8in costs from £944, the Surface Pro 12in costs £799, the Surface Pro 13in costs £1,029 and the 13in MacBook Air M4 costs £999. Verdict The Surface Laptop 13in is a smaller, cut-down version of Microsoft’s excellent Windows 11 laptop. The general feel of the machine is very similar to its larger siblings thanks to premium materials, a great keyboard and clutter-free Windows 11 experience. The 13in touchscreen is decent, if not quite as good as other models, and the older-technology trackpad still works well. Microsoft’s AI tools are slowly improving, though they are still not a reason to buy a machine. The lack of USB4/Thunderbolt and face recognition can be overlooked for a cheaper price, as can the lower-power chip. It proved more than fast enough for general productivity, and helps provide long battery life that could see out two full work days between charges. The Arm chip brings with it some potential app compatibility problems that are worth checking out before buying. Overall, the small Surface Laptop is a lovely machine. But at £900 or equivalent it’s not terribly cheap, with its larger and better sibling often available for similar money, so it’s worth shopping around. Pros: good keyboard, decent trackpad, good speakers, USB-A and USB-C, decent screen, fingerprint reader, long battery life, solid performance, clutter-free Windows 11 with AI features. Cons: app and game compatibility issues with Arm chip, screen only 60Hz and less crisp than larger siblings, no face recognition, no USB4, no haptic touchpad, a little expensive.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft", "companies": ["Microsoft"]}

Figures for September suggest four in 10 of those using Microsoft Windows worldwide were still using Windows 10, despite the introduction of its successor, Windows 11, in 2021. What is happening to Windows 10? After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide standard free software updates, security fixes or technical assistance to Windows 10 PCs. This means computers running the software will still work but it will steadily become more vulnerable to viruses and malware as bugs and security holes are discovered. Microsoft says the more up-to-date system, Windows 11, “meets the current demands for heightened security by default”. What’s the risk? If Windows users do nothing, they could become particularly vulnerable to hackers who are attracted to wide-scale systemic weaknesses. The consumer group Which? warned that about 5 million British computer users plan to continue using devices running the software. Wherever in the world you are, by continuing to use Windows 10 you will put yourself at risk of cyber-attacks, data theft and scams. Criminals “are going to target people, they are going to exploit weaknesses and they are going to want to steal your data,” says Lisa Barber, the editor of Which? Tech magazine. How do I reduce the threat? The most straightforward move is to update to Windows 11 for free. If your PC is less than four years old it will probably be able to run Windows 11. To find out, check your computer specifications. The minimum specifications for Windows 11 are 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but computers also need a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM 2.0), which stores credentials in a secure chip, similar to all modern smartphones. Microsoft has a free tool to check whether a computer running Windows 10 will support Windows 11 and Which? has an online tool to check compatibility based on the processor in your computer. What if my computer lacks the necessary hardware to upgrade to Windows 11? Doing nothing could leave you vulnerable to malware and other security breaches. One option is to sign up for Microsoft’s one-year extended security update, which will ensure protection until 13 October 2026. That will give you another year to plan for the end of support and make alternative arrangements. Signing up is free if you log into Windows 10 with a Microsoft account to sync your settings, otherwise you will need to pay $30, plus tax, or redeem 1,000 reward points. Is there an alternative to Windows 11? Other computer operating systems can provide safe and secure use for PCs that cannot upgrade to Windows 11. One solution is to install Linux, which is a family of free operating systems that come in various flavours or “distributions”. Make sure you back up all your files to an external drive or similar safe storage, as replacing Windows is likely to wipe them or make them hard to access. One of the most popular and user-friendly versions of Linux is Canonical’s Ubuntu, which is free, open source and supported with security updates. You will need a USB flash drive to install it in place of Windows, but Canonical has a step-by-step guide you can follow. Bear in mind that while plenty of software supports Linux, not all Windows apps will have Linux versions. Alternatively, if most of what you need a computer for can be performed using a browser, Google offers a version of its lightweight ChromeOS that can be installed on a number of PCs for free. Check that your model is supported and then follow Google’s ChromeOS Flex installation guide. You will need a USB flash drive. Buy a new computer If your computer cannot install alternative software or you need Windows, then another alternative is simply to buy a new PC with Windows 11 and support. Many retailers operate trade-in schemes that take back your old computer for recycling and offer a small discount on new models. Alternatively, refurbished Windows 11 machines are widely available from various retailers, such as Currys, marketplaces such as Back Market and manufacturers, such as Dell for lower cost.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft", "companies": ["Microsoft"]}

Tech companies", "date": null, "author": "Dara Kerr", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "Donald Trump’s AI summit in Washington this week was a fanfare-filled event catered to the tech elite. The president took the stage on Wednesday evening, as the song God Bless the USA piped over the loudspeakers, and then he decreed: “America must once again be a country where innovators are rewarded with a green light, not strangled with red tape, so they can’t move, so they can’t breathe.” The message was clear – the tech regulatory environment that was once the focus of federal lawmakers is no longer. “I’ve been watching for many years,” Trump continued. “I’ve watched regulation. I’ve been a victim of regulation.” As Trump spoke to the crowd, he addressed them as “the group of smart ones … the brain power”. In front of him were tech leaders, venture capitalists and billionaires, including Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang and Palantir’s chief technology officer Shyam Sankar. The Hill and Valley Forum, an influential tech industry interest group, co-hosted the confab, along with the Silicon Valley All-in Podcast, which is hosted by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks. Dubbed “Winning the AI Race”, the forum was an opportunity for the president to deliver what he called the “AI action plan”, which aims to loosen restrictions on the development and deployment of artificial intelligence. The cornerstone of that plan are three executive orders that Trump said will turn the US into an “AI export powerhouse” and roll back some of the rules put in place by the Biden administration, which included guardrails around safe and secure AI development. “Winning the AI race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in Silicon Valley – and long beyond Silicon Valley,” Trump said. One executive order targets what the White House calls “woke” AI and requires any company receiving federal funding to maintain AI models free from “ideological dogmas such as DEI”. But the other two focus on deregulation, a major demand of American tech leaders who have taken an increasingly bullish stand on government oversight. One of those promotes the export of “American AI” to other countries and the other eases environmental rules and expedites federal permitting for power-hungry data centers. Millions in lobbying To get to this moment, tech companies have been forging a friendly relationship with Trump. The CEOs of Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Apple donated to the president’s inauguration fund and met with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, has become a close ally of Trump, and Nvidia’s Huang has also cozied up with the president with promises of investing $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years. “The reality is that big tech companies are still spending tens of millions of dollars to curry favor with lawmakers and shape tech legislation,” said Alix Fraser, the vice-president of advocacy for the nonprofit Issue One. In a report released on Tuesday, Issue One looked at lobbying spending in 2025 and found that the tech industry has spent record-breaking sums. Eight of the largest tech companies spent a combined $36m – that’s an average of about $320,000 per day when Congress is in session, according to Issue One. Meta spent the most, $13.8m, and has hired 86 lobbyists this year, according to the report. And Nvidia and OpenAI saw the biggest increases, with Nvidia spending 388% more than the same time last year, and OpenAI spending 44% more. In the lead-up to Trump’s unveiling of his AI plan, more than 100 prominent labor, environmental, civil rights and academic groups countered the president and signed a “People’s AI action plan”. In a statement, the groups stressed the need for “relief from the tech monopolies” that they say “sacrifice the interests of everyday people for their own profits”. “We can’t let big tech and big oil lobbyists write the rules for AI and our economy at the expense of our freedom and equality, workers and families’ wellbeing, even the air we breathe and the water we drink – all of which are affected by the unrestrained and unaccountable rollout of AI,” the groups wrote. Meanwhile, tech companies and industry groups celebrated the executive orders. Microsoft, IBM, Dell, Meta, Palantir, Nvidia, Anthropic, xAI and others praised the plan. James Czerniawski, the head of emerging technology policy at the Consumer Choice Center, a pro-business lobbying group, heralded Trump’s AI plan as a “bold vision”. “This is a world of difference from the hostile regulatory approach of the Biden administration,” Czerniawski concluded.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Microsoft", "companies": ["Microsoft"]}

One in four of an estimated 21 million UK people using a device that runs the Windows 10 software intend to continue using it after updates cease and so will be at risk of online security breaches including malware and viruses, according to a survey by Which? More than a third of those who are not planning to take action and therefore risk becoming vulnerable are people aged over 55. The move is also predicted to add to the e-waste mountain with millions of PCs worldwide predicted to become obsolete if they cannot be updated and many customers taking the opportunity to buy new hardware. Microsoft is encouraging consumers to use recycling initiatives. The issue affects hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses using Windows 10 globally. Industry estimates suggest as many as 13% of computers currently running the software will need to be replaced. For the other devices, the solution is relatively simple and involves upgrading to Windows 11 if a PC supports it. Alternatively Microsoft is offering a one-year extension to Windows 10 to give users time to assess alternatives. But the survey by Which? found that while 39% of current users would update their Windows package, 26% said they intended to continue using version 10 after updates ceased. “Millions of people may be unprepared for the phasing out of Windows 10 next week,” said Lisa Barber, the editor of Which? Tech magazine. “If you have a home laptop or PC running Windows, now is the time to check which version you’re using and if it’s Windows 10 or older, make a plan of action. If you don’t act, you could become more vulnerable to hackers and scams.” In a blog, Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive vice-president, said that after security and feature updates and technical support for Windows 10 PCs stopped, devices would be “more vulnerable to cyber-threats, such as malware and viruses.” “Applications running on Windows 10 may no longer be supported, as the platform is no longer receiving feature updates,” he said. “As a result, some apps may experience decreased functionality.” What is happening to Windows 10? After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide software updates, security fixes or technical assistance to Windows 10 PCs.

The setting is weird: an iridescent, far-future imagining of New England where organic and non-organic matter mingle in strange, alchemical ways. And the characters are undeniably quirky: one is a bird called Twig whose beak is made from driftwood. Strangest of all: you play as a lighthouse that has inexplicably become animate, sprouting tiny, spindly little legs to carry its wibbling, wobbling body. In the sea of action-hero young men and, to a lesser degree, women, the lighthouse stands out as an unlikely star. Creative lead Lee Petty is a little fuzzy on the details of how it came to be. Rather, he talks about the creation of the protagonist as he does the broader action-adventure experience: as if it rose out of his subconscious. Despite the ostensible absurdity, Petty believes there is a certain intuition about it. “You have a light, and light has a very strong connection with life,” he says. “You can imagine the verbs for the player, and the actions, puzzles, mechanics that fall out of that.” The lighthouse’s illuminated beacon is the primary way you interact with the game’s teeming island setting. In “unfocused” mode, you direct the beam about a fantastical environment, causing foliage and small creatures to grow, change and morph. In “focused” mode, the light’s power is concentrated: larger objects undergo transformation while some materials are repelled or attracted; this is the basis of the game’s more involved puzzles. Keeper’s world is one of gauzy, psychedelic purples and deep, verdant greens. We see bioluminescent rock formations, tree-sized tendrils protruding from their gigantic flower heads, and a gorgeous, whale-like creature floating through the sky, vegetation growing unexpectedly on its back. This ecological extravaganza is partly inspired by 1980s fantasy movies such as The Dark Crystal and The NeverEnding Story, “weird” and “imperfect” works, admits Petty, yet “so earnest in their desire to create a world that you haven’t seen before”. Real life proved just as inspiring for the creative lead. During Covid lockdowns, he walked alone in the pretty foothills south of his San Francisco home. Petty gazed at the abundant vegetation while meditating on what the planet might look like should humanity cease to exist. He was also reading books and watching movies about mycelium networks, thinking deeply about the interconnectedness and interdependence of ecosystems. This deluge of feelings, real-world circumstances and reference material coalesced as a fever dream, says Petty. He envisioned a “a weird island, a sort of surreal, post-human thing, where life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways”. The game’s genesis arrived shortly after Petty’s award-winning employer Double Fine, maker of trippy platformer Psychonauts 2, Stacking and many other idiosyncratic titles, was acquired by Microsoft. The new management was receptive to his experimental idea: he was given the time and resources to explore the concept before locking down its form. Keeper seems to have embodied the laid-back approach of its making: the vibe is languorously dreamy with many opportunities to slow down and smell the enchanting and totally bizarre roses. “You’re not rushed along, you’re not given mission objectives. There are no pop-ups on the screen with meta-rewards,” says Petty. “You’re kind of left to dwell in the space.” And yet there is a grim irony that may yet sour this sweet, whimsical experience: Keeper’s vivid celebration of life is being funded by Microsoft at a time when the company’s cloud-based storage platform Azure has been used to facilitate the preparation of deadly airstrikes and military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has called for the boycott of Microsoft and Xbox products. Recently, unionised workers at French studio Arkane, also owned by Microsoft, issued an open letter stating that its parent company “has no place being accomplice of a genocide”. Microsoft has since announced that it is investigating the use of its platform in this manner, which it states is a breach of the terms of service. Petty, of course, is far removed from the decisions made by his bosses at Microsoft, and he stresses as much. He says this is the “downside” of being owned by a much larger organisation, one whose purview extends far beyond entertainment. “I’m not in control. Double Fine is not necessarily tacitly endorsing anything of our parent company,” he says. “We’re just trying to make great games.” • Keeper is due for release on PC and Xbox in October • This article was amended on 29 August 2025 to clarify that Microsoft is investigating the use of its Azure technology by the Israeli Defence Forces.", "section": "Games", "query": "Microsoft", "companies": ["Microsoft"]}

And now is the time to celebrate apples, so this week I’m giving them the attention they deserve in a no-bake toffee apple pie (banoffee’s autumn cousin) and a soft, cinnamon-spiced crumb cake. Toffee apple pie (pictured top) You will need a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 10 min Chill 2 hr+ Serves 8-10 For the case 275g digestive biscuits ¼ tsp fine sea salt 1 tsp ground cinnamon 140g unsalted butter, melted For the caramelised apples 500g apples, I used braeburn, but pink lady work well, too 70g caster sugar 30g butter 1 tsp lemon juice For the sour cream whip 50g sour cream 250ml double cream 25g caster sugar To assemble 397g tin dulce de leche (I used Carnation) 25g roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped For the biscuit base, blitz or bash the digestives into fine crumbs. Mix in the salt and cinnamon, then pour in the melted butter and mix well until it has the texture of very wet sand and clumps together when you give it a gentle squeeze. Press evenly into a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin (put a disc of baking paper on the base for an easier release later), starting with the edges and working your way into the base. Put the tin in the fridge to firm up. Meanwhile, peel and core the apples, then cut them into even slices, about 1cm wide (you should have about 400g). In a low, wide frying pan, add the caster sugar and heat over a medium-high heat until it starts to melt, caramelise, and even burn in places – three to four minutes. Add the butter and apples, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mixture come to a bubble. Lower the heat, then simmer the apples in the juices for about 10 minutes, or until tender. (Depending on the variety, you might get a mixture of mushier and firmer pieces.) Stir in the lemon juice, then remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool. To assemble, beat the dulce de leche until smooth, then spread evenly over the biscuit base. Arrange the apple slices (avoiding the juices) on top in slightly overlapping concentric circles and in a single layer. Reserve the apple caramel juices for finishing the tart. Whip all the ingredients for the sour cream whip together until you get soft peaks. Pile the cream on top of the apples, giving it a pleasing swoop. Arrange the hazelnuts on top, then finish with drizzles of the caramelised apple juices. Chill for two to three hours before serving. Apple crumb loaf Prep 5 min Cook 1 hr 10 min Serves 6-8 You will need a 21.5cm x 11.5cm x 6cm loaf pan. For the cake 2 medium-sized eating apples 1½ tsp cinnamon 150g unsalted butter 75g caster sugar 100g light brown sugar 2 eggs, about 100g 1 tsp vanilla extract 150g plain flour 50g wholemeal flour 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (6g) ¼ tsp fine salt For the crumb 40g light brown sugar 60g plain flour A pinch of salt 30g oats 40g butter, melted Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Halve and core one apple (no need to peel), then cut it into 2mm slices (you should get about 120-130g). Toss with the cinnamon in a bowl and set aside. Grate the other apple on the coarse side of a box grater – you need about 100g. For the cake, cream the butter and sugars for about two minutes until slightly pale and about one and a half times their original volume. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition, followed by the grated apple and vanilla extract. Stir through the dry ingredients to form a batter. Line the loaf tin with baking paper, then spoon in about 80% of the mixture. Arrange the thinly sliced cinnamon apples on top in overlapping layers, then top with the remaining mixture, smoothing the top. Bake for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the crumb. Mix together the dry ingredients in a bowl (you can use the cinnamon apple bowl for less washing up!), then pour in the melted butter and mix again until a crumb forms. Carefully remove the cake from the oven and sprinkle the oat crumb all over the top. Return to the oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Leave to cool completely in the tin before serving.

Dense yet tender, plush with fruit and rich with toffee, it’s simple enough for a weekend pudding, and special enough to be served at a gathering. Toffee apple pudding cake Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Cool 30 min+ Serves 8 125g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra, softened, for greasing 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 small apples, preferably granny smith 150g small, firm dried figs, chopped into roughly 1cm pieces 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 2 tsp baking powder ½ tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp fine sea salt 200g light muscovado sugar 1 large egg 1 tsp vanilla extract For the toffee apple topping 3 small apples, preferably granny smith 100g unsalted butter 100g light brown muscovado sugar 1 tsp lemon juice 100ml double cream ¼ tsp flaky sea salt Grease a 23cm bundt tin thoroughly with the extra softened butter, then dust some flour all over the inside. Rotate to coat tin entirely, then turn upside down and tap firmly over a bin to remove the excess flour. Set aside in a cool place. Peel, core and cut the apples into roughly 1cm dice (you will need 200g diced flesh), then place in a medium saucepan. Add the chopped figs and 250ml water, put on a medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit breaks down and most of the liquid has evaporated – the mix should remain moist and spoonable, not dry.

Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool for at least 30 minutes, then invert the cake on to a serving plate. Meanwhile, make the toffee apples. Peel, core and quarter the apples, then cut each quarter into four. Put a tablespoon of the butter and two tablespoons of the sugar in a large saute pan, add the apples and lemon juice, then cook, stirring regularly, over a medium heat for eight to 10 minutes, until the apples soften and turn golden. Add the remaining butter and sugar, stir to melt, then add the cream and salt, and stir gently to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for one or two minutes, until thick and glossy. Take off the heat and spoon the apples all over the top of the cake. Serve with cream or creme fraiche. Baking and the Meaning of Life by Helen Goh (Murdoch Books, £26).

That’s because Apple has finally brought one of the best features of modern smartphones to its base-model flagship phone: a super-smooth 120Hz screen. And it has done so, while also doubling the starting storage, without increasing the price. The iPhone 17 still starts at the same £799 (€949/$799/A$1,399) as its predecessor, sitting below the £999 Air and £1,099 Pro, while offering a lot of iPhone for the money. From the outside it doesn’t look as if anything has changed since the iPhone 16, but the 17 is ever so slightly taller to squeeze in the bigger screen with slimmer borders without making the phone materially larger. The 6.3in screen now matches the super-bright display on the 17 Pro covered with significantly toughened glass to better resist scratches. The 120Hz “Pro Motion” tech is the best bit, doubling the refresh rate of the screen to make scrolling and animations much smoother and more responsive. It has been a feature common to rival smartphones for years, but Apple has until this point reserved it for Pro models of the iPhone, MacBooks and iPads. The 17 also has the previously Pro-only always-on display feature, which shows the time, widgets and notifications while the phone is idle. And it runs the same iOS 26 with Apple’s new glass-like interface design as the rest of the iPhone lineup. It looks a bit different and some elements have been simplified or condensed to get out of the way of the content you’re trying to see, but generally it works the same with some nice touches here and there. Specifications Screen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A19 RAM: 8GB Storage: 256 or 512GB Operating system: iOS 26 Camera: 48MP main + 48MP UW; 18MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 149.6 x 71.5 x 7.95mm Weight: 177g Rapid A19 chip and solid battery life The iPhone 17 has Apple’s new A19 chip, which is only a little less powerful than the A19 Pro in the other models this year, making it one of the fastest chips in a smartphone. Apple still has a lead over Android rivals in processors, even in cheaper models. As a result the 17 handles everything you could want to do with a phone with aplomb. Battery life is also good for a phone of this size, lasting a solid 44 hours of mixed usage across wifi and 5G between charges, actively using the screen for about six hours and with the always-on display feature turned on. That’s slightly shorter than its predecessor, but slightly longer than the similarly sized 17 Pro and a fair bit longer than the iPhone Air. Most people will need to charge the 17 every other day. Sustainability The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. The phone contains more than 30% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down its environmental impact in a report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The 17 has two 48-megapixel cameras on the back – one main and one ultrawide – plus Apple’s new 18MP centre stage selfie camera, as seen on the iPhone 17 Pro and Air. The main camera remains unchanged from the iPhone 16 and shoots great photos across a range of lighting conditions. Occasionally it can be blown out by bright lights or suffer from a bit of blur or grain in low-light conditions, but it is a reliably good point-and-shoot camera. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which works great in good light and OK in dimmer indoor lighting. The ultrawide is an upgrade on predecessors, shooting with greater detail and range. It works particularly well for the macro mode for closeup photos. The camera can digitally zoom up 10x, but the resulting photos lack detail and sharpness. A real camera zoom is still limited to the Pro models on an iPhone. The new front-facing camera shoots solid selfies, which are slightly better than previous iPhones. But its party piece is the ability to automatically pan and zoom to fit everyone in for group shots, no matter which orientation you hold the phone. Shooting landscape photos while holding your phone in portrait is surprisingly useful. The 17 has plenty of modes to play about with and shoots great video, including a dual-capture feature that records from the front and back cameras at the same time to put the photographer into the shot in a little window. Price The iPhone 17 starts from £799 (€949/$799/A$1,399) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone Air costs £999, iPhone 17 Pro costs £1,099, the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 costs £799, the Samsung Galaxy S25 costs £699 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499. Verdict The iPhone 17 may not look all that different from last year’s model, but it is a meaningful upgrade on all the standard model iPhones that have come before. That’s because it has key features pulled down from Apple’s pricier Pro models, including a significantly better, brighter and 120Hz-smooth screen. It’s a must-have feature that has been standard on rival phones for years. The always-on display is super handy too, while double the starting storage to 256GB and about two-day battery life is very welcome. For the first time in many years, using the iPhone 17 doesn’t feel like a significant downgrade from the Pro models. The dual camera on the back is good, but the lack of a telephoto option keeps it from being great. The iPhone 17 still feels compact for a modern phone, and while not quite as featherlight as the iPhone Air, it isn’t exactly heavy. Unless you need a camera zoom, the standard iPhone 17 is the one to get for Apple buyers. It’s great. Pros: rapid, great 120Hz screen, good dual camera with macro mode, at least 256GB storage, great size, action and camera control buttons, USB-C, good battery life, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no telephoto camera, samey design, not the thinnest, lightest or most powerful model.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}

Fruit and squashes have ripened weeks earlier than normal in many places and yields are higher thanks to near-ideal conditions, including 2024’s wet weather followed by a warm and dry spring and plenty of summer sun this year. It is a stark contrast to last autumn, when wet weather boosted slug and snail numbers, resulting in pumpkin and squash crops being wrecked. The National Trust’s plant health and sustainability consultant, Rebecca Bevan, said: “Climate change has brought us some very challenging growing conditions over recent years with extremes of wet and dry weather and many storms. “It’s heartening that sometimes the conditions lead to good outcomes and fruit harvests are a success story for 2025.” At Cotehele in Cornwall, for example, where its “mother orchard” is home to more than 100 varieties of apple tree, thousands of pieces of fruit have been produced far earlier than expected this year. The head gardener, David Bouch, said: “The warm, mild spring resulted in bountiful blossom and despite the summer’s record-breaking temperatures we have had an amazing crop of apples. “A month ago, I wasn’t overly confident because the fruit was very small which is usually the case in very dry summers, but the apples have swollen quickly over the last couple of weeks thanks to the rain we’ve had.” At Buckland Abbey near Plymouth in Devon, the kitchen garden is overflowing with squash and pumpkins. Its head gardener, Sam Brown, said: “We have about 50% more squash and pumpkins than usual. We’d normally harvest them in mid-October but are about to start now.” In north Wales, a bumper crop of vintage apples, including St Cecilia and King of the Pippins, has been reported this year at Erddig Hall. Its head gardener, Andrew Degg, said: “Usually, we pick about 2 tonnes and this year we are on target for 4 tonnes.” The head gardener at Hughenden in Buckinghamshire, Claire Primett, said: “Typically 40% of the trees fruit each year, but this year it is almost double that.” At The Vyne in Hampshire, a former Tudor palace, the aptly named Frogmore Prolific apple is doing exceptionally well, as are the Autumn Pearmain and Golden Reinette varieties. It has also been a good year for apples and pears in the north of England. At Beningbrough Hall in North Yorkshire its Irish Peach tree normally produces just one or two apples, but this year there have been 40. At Sissinghurst in Kent, heritage pumpkin varieties such as Marina di Chioggia and Rouge Vif d’Etampes are thriving. Its gardener, Olivia Steed-Mundin, said: “They have loved the heat over the summer. Some are already ripe, and they store beautifully for up to six months if cured [hardened] properly. “This can be done by placing them in a dry, sunny and warm environment for a few weeks. A greenhouse or sunny windowsill is ideal. After that they should be stored in dry, coolish conditions for long-term storage.”", "section": "UK news", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}

Otherwise the new model is a direct replacement for the Series 10, matching it in design, dimensions and features, with most of its upgrades coming from software. That makes it one of the very best smartwatches available, even if it hasn’t changed much. The Series 11 is also £30 cheaper in the UK, costing from £369 (€449/$399/A$679), and sits above the newly revamped £219 Watch SE at the low end and the £749 Ultra 3 at the high end. Like last year’s Series 10, the new model is only 9.7mm thick, which makes it a slim fit to the wrist, easy to sneak under cuffs and more comfortable at night. It is light, slim and easy to live with. The 2,000nit OLED screen is plenty bright for seeing indoors and out, remaining clear to read off-angle, which makes glancing down at the time or notifications easy. It is covered by glass that Apple says is twice as scratch resistant as before, although not as hard as sapphire, which is reserved for the more expensive titanium models. The new watch has the same S10 chip as last year’s model but now supports optional 5G and stronger reception for those times when you’re in the wilderness. The batteries have increased in capacity by 9% and 11% for the 42mm and 46mm watches respectively. The 46mm lasted a good two days in testing with sleep tracking but without exercise. Most people will just about be able to track two days and two nights before needing a charge, which takes 66 minutes using a 20W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting about 70% in 30 minutes. If you do go out for a run, it will last about eight hours of tracking, which is long enough for a marathon or two. Specifications Case size: 42 or 46mm Case thickness: 9.7mm Weight: about 30g or 37g Processor: S10 Storage: 64GB Operating system: watchOS 26 Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, mic, speaker, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeter Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 4, NFC, UWB, optional 5G watchOS 26 The Series 11 ships with watchOS 26, which runs on all models from 2020’s Series 6 and newer. It adds Apple’s new Liquid Glass design, which makes most elements semi-translucent, and adds two new watch faces: a large digital face called Flow that responds to movement and an analogue face called Exactograph, which breaks out hours, minutes and seconds into their own dials. The best new feature is the wrist-flick gesture, where you rapidly twist your wrist away from you and then back to dismiss things and return to the watch face. It works even without raising your wrist to look at the watch, meaning you can dismiss alarms with a satisfying flick of the wrist. Hypertension, sleep and AI workouts The Apple Watch features the same comprehensive health monitoring suite of tools from previous models but adds a couple of new features and a redesigned workout app. Hypertension alerts look for signs of high blood pressure over a 30-day period, notifying you to get yourself checked out if your heart rate data suggests you may have a hidden problem. The new sleep score metric makes Apple’s sleep tracking easier to interpret, similar to competitors from Google, Samsung and others. Each morning the watch shows a score out of 100 that is broken down into three categories: duration, bedtime and interruptions, which are all self-explanatory and viewable in the Health app on the iPhone, too. Workout buddy is an AI coach that uses your previous workout data to give you pep talks before and after workouts, such as recognising that you have already run three times this week and the level of effort you put it. It also provides audible heads-up when you reach certain milestones during exercise, such as a particular pace, heart rate, distance, time or other metrics. There is a choice of three voices, which speak to you over Bluetooth headphones connected to your watch for one of 12 activities, including walking, running or cycling. However, it only works if you also carry your iPhone 15 Pro or later with you, which I found irritating enough that I would forgo the feature to avoid being encumbered with a phone on runs. Sustainability Apple says the battery should last more than 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Repairs cost between £295 and £389 depending on the model. It contains more than 40% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report. Price The Series 11 comes in two sizes (42 and 46mm), a choice of materials and the option of 5G that requires an eSim and compatible phone plan add-on. It starts at £369 (€449/$399/A$679). The 5G models cost an extra £100 (€120/$100/A$170). For comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 costs £749, the Apple Watch SE 3 costs from £219, the Google Pixel Watch 4 costs from £349 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 costs from £294. Verdict The Series 11 hasn’t changed the winning Apple Watch formula but it has added two things that most will appreciate: more scratch-resistant glass and longer battery life. The slim design, fast charging and two-day battery life make the watch easy to live with, particularly for sleep tracking and use as a silent alarm clock. The wrist-flick gesture is so good every watch should have it, while compatibility with straps and charging pucks for all previous Apple Watches is a great bonus for those upgrading. A price cut in the UK is welcome, too. The glass-like design of watchOS 26 may take some getting used to but the software works just the same and introduces some useful features including hypertension alerts, which could be lifesaving. Workout buddy is the most interesting feature. It was a far more positive experience than I was expecting but relies on working out with your phone, too, which is a bit of a drag for runs. Overall, the Series 11 is one of the very best smartwatches available for the iPhone, and if you have an older watch such as a Series 6, you will see a massive upgrade. However, this year its status as the default Apple Watch to buy has been challenged by the revamped Watch SE 3, which offers better value if not quite as many features or as refined a design. Pros: great always-on screen, slim design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, top health tracking, great activity tracking, workout buddy AI trainer, 50-metre water resistance, two-day battery life, optional 5G, long software support, recycled materials, takes older watch straps. Cons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, looks the same as all recent models, undercut by Watch SE.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}

The Ultra 3 is Apple’s answer to adventure watches such as Garmin’s Fenix 8 Pro while being a full smartwatch for the iPhone with all the trimmings. As such, it is not cheap, costing from £749 (€899/$799/A$1,399) – £50 less than 2023’s model – sitting above the £369-plus Series 11 and £219 Watch SE 3. From the outside it doesn’t look like a lot has changed for the Ultra 3 over its two-year-old predecessor. Available in natural or black titanium, it is exactly the same size but squeezes in a slightly bigger screen with smaller bezels making it the largest on an Apple Watch. The display is much brighter when viewed at an angle, which makes seeing it at a glance a lot easier, and now shows ticking seconds when idle like the Series 10 and 11. It is very bright, covered by super-hard sapphire glass and has one of the very best screens on a watch. The Ultra 3 has the same S10 chip as the Series 11 and the same excellent touch-free gestures. Double tap your thumb and index finger to press buttons or scroll, or flick your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss alarms, notifications or return to the watch face. Apple has managed to fit a 6% larger battery into the Ultra 3, which lasts a good three-plus days between charges with general usage and sleep tracking over night. Most people will need to put it on the charger every third night, which is a good day longer than any other Apple Watch, although some way behind the week-long battery of adventure watch rivals from Garmin and others. The watch fully charges in about two hours, hitting 50% in 30 minutes via the included USB-C magnetic charging puck. Satellite and 5G The watch supports 5G, if you have a compatible phone plan, and has noticeably stronger cellular reception in weaker signal areas for 4G. Apple has also brought its free satellite SOS messaging from the iPhone to the Ultra 3, which allows you to contact the emergency services via text using satellites when out of cellular signal range. Satellites can also be used for Find My location tracking and messages to friends and loved ones, although the latter is only available in the US, Canada and Mexico, and both need a compatible cellular data plan. The Ultra 3 runs the same recent watchOS 26 software as the Series 11 and other Apple Watches, which introduced a revamped design and some new watch faces. In addition, the Ultra 3 has an attractive new Waypoint watch face, which has a live compass that shows points of interest around you. It joins a few other information-dense Ultra-exclusive faces, including the Wayfinder and Modular Ultra. Specifications Case size: 49 x 44mm Case thickness: 12mm Weight: 61.8g Processor: S10 Storage: 64GB Operating system: watchOS 26 Water resistance: 100 metres (10ATM) Sensors: HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, dual-band GPS, compass, altimeter Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, wifi n, NFC, UWB, satellite, optional 5G/eSIM Top-notch sport and health tracking The Ultra supports the same comprehensive health and fitness-tracking capabilities as the standard Apple Watch. That includes a wealth of heart health monitoring, such as ECG, abnormal rhythm notifications, blood oxygen tracking, and new hypertension alerts that analyse 30-days of readings for signs of high blood pressure. It has Apple’s new sleep score metric, which makes it easier to understand your tracked sleep, plus wrist temperature monitoring, cycle tracking with ovulation estimation and many other tools. The Ultra builds on the workout tracking of the standard Apple Watch in a couple of ways. The extra action button in the side can be used to quickly start a workout, but unlike Apple’s other watches you can wait until you have a GPS lock before starting the exercise by pressing it again. The best bit is a dual-band GPS system that boosts tracking accuracy in tricky environments, such as dense urban areas with tall buildings or in woods. It’s a feature found on the top running watches and has been improved since the initial Ultra to become one of the most accurate on the market, matching or beating the very best in urban GPS stress tests. It also tracks a good number of metrics including the usual distance, pace and cadence, plus running power and dynamics, training load and heart rate zones. It can be loaded with structured workouts such as intervals, and it has a very good track detection mode for doing laps. The Ultra has similarly good cycling, swimming and triathlon profiles, plus diving to 40-metre depths and at least 22 other activities. Combined with the large and bright screen, and the decent 11 to 14-hour battery life when tracking running at its highest accuracy levels, the Ultra 3 makes for a surprisingly good sports watch. The Ultra also supports Apple’s new Workout Buddy AI coach, which works with walks, runs, hikes, cycling and various other training workouts, giving you pep-talks before, during and after activities via Bluetooth headphones. But it requires you to carry an iPhone 15 Pro or later for it to work, which is a drag. Sustainability Apple says the battery should last more than 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £95. Damage repairs cost £489. The watch contains more than 40% recycled material, including cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report. Price The Apple Watch Ultra 3 comes in a choice of two colours and multiple bands costing from £749 (€899/$799/A$1,399). Verdict The Ultra 3 is the biggest, baddest and best Apple Watch the company makes but it isn’t a massive leap over previous models. Other than satellite SOS messaging, which could genuinely save your life in an emergency, the rest of the watch is simply a refinement of the Ultra 2. But the added battery life is very welcome, so is a bigger and fancier screen in the same size watch. New software features are great and the wrist-flick gesture for dismissing things is the best thing added to any Apple Watch in recent memory. The Ultra is still a rarer sight than other models, so if you wanted a less ubiquitous Apple Watch this is it. While those looking for a dedicated top-priced sports watch might overlook it in favour of a Garmin or similar, the Ultra 3 has all the ingredients to be a first-rate training companion – as long as you can charge it more frequently – while still being the best smartwatch you can get with an iPhone. The Ultra 3 is the best Apple Watch. Just don’t expect it to be a massive upgrade over older Ultra models. Pros: fantastic screen, rugged yet sophisticated design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, three-day battery life, 5G and satellite SOS/messaging, top health tracking, great activity tracking with dual-band GPS, extra action button, 100-metre water resistance and 40-metre dive-ready, long software support. Cons: very expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, no big upgrade on previous Ultra models, shorter battery life than adventure watch rivals.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}

That alone will make the iPhone 17 Pro popular for those looking to upgrade and be seen with the newest model. But with the change comes an increase in price to £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999), crossing the £1,000 barrier for the first time for Apple’s smallest Pro phone, which now comes with double the starting storage. From the front it looks like any recent Pro iPhone with the Dynamic Island containing the selfie camera at the top of the super bright and smooth screen. It is one of the best screens on a phone but identical to the regular iPhone 17, which has been upgraded this year. The aluminium sides have been softened with a slight rounding to the edges, giving the phone a nice and comfortable feel in your hand without being too slippery. The phone has gained 5g in weight, which has pushed it over the 200g mark, making it on the heavier side for a smaller handset. A glass panel slightly larger than a credit card is inlaid into the aluminium body and is where MagSafe or Qi2.2 chargers and accessories attach. The large metal “plateau” at the top houses the cameras, which is even bigger than the camera bar on a Pixel. The aluminium will not crack like glass when dropped but it is more scratch-prone, particularly around the edges of the plateau, so a case is still prudent. The handset runs the same iOS 26 as the rest of the iPhone lineup, which introduced Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” interface design. Generally it works well, but it has caused a bit of division over the transparency effects used for buttons and other elements, which blend into the background a little too much sometimes. Specifications Screen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A19 Pro RAM: 12GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iOS 26 Camera: 48MP main, 48MP UW and 48MP 4x zoom, 18MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, Satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 150 x 71.9 x 8.75mm Weight: 204g Faster and cooler A19 Pro chip The 17 Pro has a new Apple A19 Pro chip at its heart, which is coupled for the first time in an iPhone with a vapour chamber cooling system. It is a common technique used in many high-performing Android phones and extracts heat from the chip, dispersing it into the rest of the phone’s body to cool it down and keep it running at peak performance for longer. It works well, with the back staying cooler than previous iPhones when playing games for extended sessions while producing better frame rates and being less sweaty to hold. The battery life is solid for a phone of this size, lasting about 42 hours between charges with about six hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi, which is about two hours longer than last year’s model. On heavy-use days out and about or playing lots of games, the 17 Pro still managed to end the day with a good 25% left in the tank. Most people will need to charge the phone every other day for regular use. Sustainability The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. The specialists iFixit awarded the phone a seven out of 10 for repairability. It contains more than 30% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera There are three 48-megapixel cameras on the back and a new 18MP selfie camera with a few new tricks on the front. The main and ultra-wide cameras are very similar to last year, shoot some great photos across a range of lighting conditions and are particularly good for street photography with solid detail. The main camera offers a 2x crop zoom, which is great, appearing similar in detail and colour to 1x shots in good light, although a little more grainy in dimmer lighting. New for this year is an upgraded telephoto camera that is now 4x at 48MP, up from 5x at 12MP, which produces very good, well-balanced photos that are full of detail. It can manage an 8x crop zoom similar to the main camera, which is equally good in bright light with only a slight degradation of detail. Both zoom levels do pretty well in dimmer indoor light, too. All three cameras shoot some of the best video on a phone and have many other features, including an excellent macrophotography mode and the ability to shoot video from the front and rear cameras simultaneously, placing the operator into a little window. Apple’s automatic portrait mode is solid and works with objects, not only people and pets. Finally, the selfie camera has had its first upgrade on an iPhone in many years, beefed up to an 18MP sensor with Apple’s Centre Stage tech from its iPads and Macs. It has the ability to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame for video calls but it can also expand the frame to shoot landscape selfies when holding the phone in portrait orientation. It’s a novel solution to the problem of trying to fit everyone in for group selfies without having to turn the phone. Price The iPhone 17 Pro costs from £1,099 (€1,299/$1,099/A$1,999) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone 17 costs £799, iPhone Air costs £999, iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 Pro costs £999, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,099 and the Fairphone 6 costs £499. Verdict The 17 Pro is the first different-looking iPhone in years, which instantly makes it stand out despite not being functionally all that different from recent models. The new aluminium unibody design feels nice, although it will scratch more easily than glass. The screen and performance are top-notch, while the battery life is solid for a fairly compact handset. It is a really nice iPhone and one of the very best phones that isn’t ginormous. But this year it competes with the super-thin iPhone Air, which steals some of the limelight, and an upgraded standard iPhone 17, which is cheaper but matches the Pro on screen quality for the first time, although it lacks a zoom camera. That leaves the camera as the big differentiator. The 17 Pro has top-notch cameras including a new and improved telephoto camera, which is one of the best in the business. So for an iPhone buyer who wants a telephoto camera to zoom in on your subjects, the 17 Pro is the model to get. You just have to pay a pretty penny for it. Pros: looks different to other models, relatively compact, great cameras including 4x/8x telephoto, upgraded selfie camera, great screen, USB-C, good battery life, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: expensive, heavier than previous models, lack of cutting-edge AI features compared with rivals, same screen and size can be found on cheaper model.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}
{"id": "business/2025/sep/14/bumper-apple-harvest-cider-makers-uk", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/bumper-apple-harvest-cider-makers-uk", "title": "‘Cider to the power of 10’: bumper apple harvest has UK cider makers drooling", "date": null, "author": "Zoe Wood", "publication": "The Guardian", "text": "“If you love cider, this is cider to the power of 10,” says Barny Butterfield, speaking about the flavours packed by some of this year’s “special” apples. Indeed Butterfield, the owner of Sandford Orchards, near Exeter, is buying extra tanks to increase cider production after the UK’s hottest summer on record resulted in an abundance of fruit. “I think God’s a cider maker,” he joked. To thrive, fruit trees need heat and light and this year “we had lots of both”. “I’ve had boughs breaking on trees under the weight of fruit,” Butterfield continued. “It’s probably going to be the best vintage since 2018.” With more than 20 years in the business, he declared: “It might even be the best in my cider-making lifetime. We’re looking at an incredibly special year.” The National Association of Cider Makers (NACM) says the warm spring and summer have produced apples “full of rich flavours and natural sweetness”, despite the fact that the reduced rainfall means the fruit is slightly smaller than average. “I’ve heard from cider makers and growers that the sugar and tannin levels are very high, which means the quality of the fruit will be outstanding,” said the NACM chair, David Sheppy, who is also the managing director of Sheppy’s Cider. “It is going to be a good year for quality.” The record-breaking summer temperatures this year that contributed to the abundance of apples was made about 70 times more likely because of human-induced climate change, the Met Office concluded in an analysis published earlier this month. The mean temperature across June, July and August was 16.1C (70F), significantly above the current record of 15.8C set in 2018, with the country also seeing four heatwaves across a single season. Sheppy, whose family has 36 hectares (90 acres) of orchards in Somerset, said the trees had “suffered a little bit”. Mature trees “don’t mind a dry spell”, he said, but the stress of the dry weather meant he had observed a small number that had split and lost their branches. Cider-producers have moved to make the most of this year’s bumper crop. Sandford Orchards, which makes Devon Red cider, has installed eight new 50,000-litre (11,000-gallon) tanks and Butterfield is particularly excited to have lots of Tremlett’s Bitter apples, meaning Sandford Orchards can bottle a single variety for the first time in seven years. He describes their “leathery and marmaladey” notes and “rich natural sweetness”. There is also good news for perry drinkers after last year’s disaster. Albert Johnson, director of Ross-on-Wye Cider &amp; Perry Company bills it as a “bounceback year”. “Last year was so bad for perry pears, probably over half the crop was wiped out by the bad conditions in the growing season,” he said. It is a different story this year. “If anything, the pear sugars are up even more than the apples, and there’s plenty of them. So it’s a really exciting year for perry.” Industry figures show that while UK cider sales edged up slightly to £3.1bn in 2024, the overall amount drunk declined by about 3% to 676m litres. Sheppy, the sixth generation of his family to work in cider-making, said the industry “had been in decline, but it’s picking up again”. “It’s coming back,” he said of the sector, which supports about 65,000 jobs. “There’s a lot of innovation and new ideas, both around reducing alcohol content but also at the higher end … to appeal to the modern drinker. “Like a lot of industries, cider goes through phases. But there’s a strong passion for the industry in this country. It’s a close connection with the land and farmers.” Sheppy’s harvest started at the end of last week. “We grow 40 different varieties of apples,” he said. “The earliest ones are ripening now but the main cider apple varieties, like Dabinett, Harry Masters and Yarlington Mill, are ready mid- to late October, early November. That’s the key time.” But even if this year is one to remember, Sheppy is keen to point out that the industry doesn’t have “bad years”, only “bad harvests”. “It’s not like when you get a wetter harvest, the quality is not as good, because that’s all in the blending process. We can blend a good year with a bad year and maintain the quality, that is part of the art of being a cider maker.”", "section": "Business", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}

Beyond the obvious engineering effort that has gone into creating one of the slimmest phones ever made, the Air is a reductive exercise that boils down the iPhone into the absolute essentials in a premium body. Cut away the rear cameras, slim down the battery, remove the stereo speakers and maximise the screen, and what is left is an impressive sliver of titanium and glass. Doing so isn’t cheap. The iPhone Air starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799), sitting in between the standard £799 iPhone 17 and the £1,099 17 Pro models. Photos don’t do the Air justice. You know it is something special as soon as you pick it up. Its 5.64mm-thick frame feels thinner thanks to soft edges and light weight that’s 12g less than the already quite light iPhone 17. The glass lump on the back contains most of the guts of the phone with the rest dedicated to the battery. The usual iPhone buttons line the sides including the camera control and action buttons. The earpiece speaker in the top is the only one: it is pretty good but you can tell there’s no stereo sound when watching videos, which is a bit of a shame as the 6.5in screen is smooth, bright and fantastic. The Air behaves just like any other modern iPhone. It runs iOS 26 with its glass-like design, has all the same apps, Face ID and is super responsive. There is only one hiccup and that’s the lack of a nano sim card tray, as the iPhone Air relies entirely on eSim. In the US Apple has only supported eSims since the iPhone 14, but models sold everywhere else had nano sim slots, until the Air. Most of the major networks in the UK can provide eSims, but the experience of setting it up or moving between phones isn’t great for all of them and not all budget providers support them. The mobile networks have some work to do to make eSims a good experience everywhere. Specifications Screen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED) (460ppi) Processor: Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU) RAM: 12GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iOS 26 Camera: 48MP rear; 18MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G eSim-only, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 6, Thread, USB-C, satellite, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins) Dimensions: 156.2 x 74.7 x 5.64mm Weight: 165g A19 Pro chip The Air has the A19 Pro chip similar to the iPhone 17 Pro, but with one fewer GPU core, reducing its performance a little for games and other graphics-intensive tasks. It feels rapid in daily tasks but gets noticeably warmer by the camera lump when doing intensive jobs. Despite most of the body being dedicated to the battery, a smaller capacity cell is the Air’s first big concession to slenderness. The battery life is shorter than other iPhones, but isn’t as bad as you might imagine. For relatively light days with the screen actively used for five hours for browsing, messaging and watching video mostly on wifi, the Air lasted a decent 40 hours between charges. On heavier days, shooting photos, using mapping on 5G out and about, listening to music, messaging and watching video on the commute, the Air lasted about 30 hours, ending the day with roughly 25% left. It should see out most days with a nightly charge, but if you do lots of gaming or other more intensive tasks you may need low power mode. Sustainability The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for £109. Out-of-warranty screen repairs cost £349. Specialists iFixit awarded the iPhone Air a seven out of 10 for repairability. It contains more than 35% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Camera The camera is the second big concession. The Air only has a single 48-megapixel camera on the back with the new and improved 18MP selfie camera with Centre Stage tech from the iPhone 17 line on the front. The main camera matches that from the regular iPhone 17, not the larger sensor from the 17 Pro, but performs admirably. It can shoot great photos and video in good lighting and manages dim indoor light fairly well. It can look a bit soft and grainy at times and won’t win any camera awards, but generally shoots decent photos. It can perform a 2x crop zoom, which is pretty good in brighter scenes, but zoom further and your photos have all the hallmarks of digital zoom: surfaces and people look a bit soft and detail is lost in more distant subjects. The lack of an ultrawide and telephoto camera certainly hampers the shots you can get. The only other iPhone with a single rear camera is the lower cost iPhone 16e. The 18MP front-facing camera automatically pans and zooms to fit everyone in group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies without having to turn the phone sideways, which is a neat trick. You can also shoot video from the front and rear cameras at the same time to put the photographer in the frame in a little window. Price The iPhone Air costs from £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,799) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the iPhone 16e costs £599, iPhone 17 is £799, iPhone 17 Pro is £1,099, the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199, the Google Pixel 10 costs £799, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is £899 and the Fairphone 6 sells for £499. Verdict The iPhone Air is a remarkable design seeking a problem to solve. I’m not sure many people have looked at their current smartphone and wished it would be thinner rather than having longer battery life and a better camera. The super-slender frame feels transformative when you first pick it up, but the novelty quickly wears off. As with Samsung’s equally thin Galaxy S25 Edge, the lighter weight is the most meaningful change making it easier to hold and pocket. The Air has a big screen but won’t weigh you down. The battery life is better than expected and should see out most days with some left in the tank when new, which may not be the case after a couple of years of use. Apple sells a smart MagSafe battery to add another 65% capacity to the Air, but slapping it on the back removes the benefit of the thin and light design. So does adding a case. The biggest concession is the single camera on the back. The lack of ultrawide and telephoto options is a cut too far for me using a phone as my primary method for capturing memories. But if you are an Apple buyer who wants a slender novelty that is great to hold and use, the iPhone Air is a special piece of hardware. For everyone else there are better options elsewhere. Pros: super thin and lightweight, great screen, good single rear camera, upgraded Centre Stage selfie camera, top performance, long software support, Face ID. Cons: no ultrawide or telephoto cameras, expensive, relatively short battery life, deserves to be used without a case, lack of cutting-edge AI.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}

It’s an apocryphal demonstration of how behaviours and beliefs can be adopted and perpetuated, long after the OG reasons for them fade. I’m pretty sure they could’ve just used humans and brussels sprouts as a metaphor instead. Like most veg of medieval origin, brassicas, of which sprouts are a baby-cabbage-y-version, were grown for hardiness and weather-resistance. As a result, the flavour skewed bitter, and the texture, tough and oftentimes woody. To help break this down, cooks would boil the bejesus out of them, inadvertently tripping the sulfuric (read: farty) compounds activated during digestion. So unholy was the stench that the superstitious cooks cut crosses into the bases of each sprout to ward off any evil spirits hiding between the leaves. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning While our beliefs around haunted sprouts might’ve changed, we’re still cross-hatching them for no reason, we’re still overboiling and underseasoning them, and as a result the way your grandparents felt about brussels sprouts is probably the way your kids still do. These are all behaviours that can and should be actively unlearned, lest we miss out on the bananas up the ladder, so to speak. Brussels sprouts have had a glow-up, and they’re ready for a second chance. For one thing, they don’t taste the same as Nan and Pop’s because they’re not the same. About 30 years ago, a Dutch scientist named Hans van Doorn (that’s DooRn not DooM) discovered that the flavonoids (flavour compounds) sinigrin and progoitrin were responsible for the bitterness in brussels sprouts, and are also found in mustard seeds and horseradish. Through a concentrated breeding program, Van Doorn was able to prioritise higher-yield, sweeter sprouts that were lower in these compounds. For another thing, we’ve got a better understanding of how sprouts like to be touched for maximum pleasure. The key is to work fast, either crisping the sprouts in a hot oven or air fryer, or leaving the sprouts raw and “cooking” them with acid instead of heat. I love burning halved, oiled sprouts in a searing-hot oven for 10-12 minutes, or shredding and rubbing with lemon juice and salt flakes as the base of a slaw. Another way to indemnify yourself against overcooking a sprout is to par-cook and then finish them in the pan, as I do below. If better technique is not enough to get you or your household’s eaters over the line, I still have a magic bullet or three up my sleeve. Thanks to science writers such as Harold McGee, we now have a clearer understanding of how other ingredients can mitigate bitterness; chiefly, salty things, fatty things and sweet things. Salt helps to smooth out bitterness and render a “creamier” experience of a bitter vegetable; the fats in oil, butter or schmaltzy/porky things offer a rich foil where the bitterness creates a lovely interplay, and adding sweetness offers even more dimension. I’m deploying all three in the below, which you can serve as a side. It can also stand alone, bulked up with black beluga lentils or green lentils. Kaiserfleisch is German-style smoked pork belly, with a thicker, more decadent cut and structure, earning its title “royal meat” or “emperor’s meat”. If you can’t find kaiserfleisch, any thick-cut bacon or pancetta will hit the spot here. You could even ask your butcher to lop you off a 1cm-thick slice of leg ham. You could also choose to skip the pork entirely and go for some fried shiitake mushrooms instead. Just wet fry them and add some extra oil to the pan for extra schmaltziness. I’ve used a combo of green and purple sprouts for extra visual appeal. Sometimes the novelty factor can help to increase willingness to try a new veg, handy when cooking for kids for example. There isn’t too much difference between the two – the purples just have anthocyanin (purple pigment) isolated, captured and bred into the varieties, as you might find in purple cabbage, which can deepen the colour and flavour slightly. Buttery brussels sprouts with kaiserfleisch and apple – recipe Serves 4-6 as a side 200g kaiserfleisch, cubed (or 1cm-thick piece of ham, or thick-cut bacon or pancetta) 600g brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered 1 tangy apple (I use pink lady but granny smith would also work) 5-6 dried juniper berries, crushed 50g butter Salt and freshly cracked pepper Pop kaiserfleisch into a cold pan with a splash of water and fry on medium-high heat to help render out the fat and colour the cut sides. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to the boil, then drop in the quartered sprouts for two to three minutes (you’ll know they’re ready when they’re vibrantly green). While you wait, cut the apple into 1cm cubes (skin on) and crush the juniper berries in a mortar and pestle or with the base of an olive oil bottle, then drop them both into the pan with the kaiserfleisch and crank the heat. Sizzling is good! Scoop the boiled sprouts from the pot, give the sieve/strainer a good tap to shake off excess moisture, then dump them into the pan with the kaiserfleisch and apples, drop in the butter and swish about to melt. Keep the pan sizzling for the sprouts to absorb the flavours, then switch off and taste for seasoning, adding salt and freshly cracked pepper as needed. Serve with sausages and mustard. To take it from side to main, add a tin of lentils – rinsed and drained – before you add the butter and swish them about to warm through in the pan, then switch off the heat and serve with crusty bread.", "section": "Life and style", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}

The FTSE 100 has hit a record peak of 9,715.22, and is currently trading 0.5% higher at 9,698.4. US stocks also hit new peaks after the opening bell on Wall Street, with gains of between 0.3% and 0.7% for the S&amp;P 500, tech-heavy Nasdaq and Down Jones. The Apple share price rose by around 1% to $269.86, taking the company’s market cap to $4tn, boosted by the popularity of its latest iPhone models. It has dipped just below that level again. The tech company is due to report quarterly results on Thursday. Microsoft jumped as much as 4% to a market value of $4.06tn after announcing a deal with OpenAI, and ahead of its earnings report tomorrow. Other tech companies such as Google owner Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook and Instagram parent Meta are also reporting earnings this week. Investors have been willing to take more risks after signs of easing trade tensions and ahead of a likely interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve at the end of its two-day meeting tomorrow. Wizz Air is using artificial intelligence to help cut its fuel consumption, as the new tech monitors weather patterns and calculates optimal speeds and altitudes for its planes. Michael Delehant, chief commercial and operations officer at the budget airline, told reporters that AI and machine learning now saves it 4 kilograms of fuel per flight. He said: How do you constantly manage a web of never-ending movements, day and night? It’s 24/7, all weekends, no time off. AI in the middle of our operations has been a significant step forward. The budget airline, which is headquartered in Hungary and listed on the London Stock Exchange, carries tens of millions of passengers every year. It operates short-haul flights from nine UK airports including London Gatwick, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Luton. However, it has ranked among the lowest scores for customer satisfaction for short-haul economy airlines. This year the consumer group Which? found it had an overall customer score of 51%, just above Ryanair in bottom place at 49%. The airline said it was using AI to help improve its customer service, as well as hiring more English-speaking call centre agents. Its new chatbot, Amelia, is also taking thousands of calls in a matter of hours, in what would normally take human agents “weeks”, the airline said. Delehant said: The way we look at AI is not about replacing jobs. I know there’s a lot of fear across many industries that AI is going to replace us. You shouldn’t look at it this way: I think what AI’s opportunity really is right now is to make us more bionic. Wizz Air will also be testing a business class-style booking in December, which allows a passenger to block the middle seat so they can have more room. Delehant said: There will be no big seat or anything like that…But a bit more space by blocking the middle seats...There are so many low cost business travellers. They own their own businesses, they don’t want to spend first class prices or business class...but they’d like a little more space. The bond fund manager Pimco has reportedly sold most of its debt position in Thames Water as the crisis-hit water company edges closer to a private sector rescue deal, aimed at staving off temporary nationalisation. Sky News reported that Pimco, run by the former Man Group boss Emmanuel Roman, has in recent weeks reduced its exposure to Thames Water’s mountain of debt by selling hundreds of millions of pounds of debt – the majority of its holdings – to fellow investors including Apollo Global Management, Elliott Advisors and Silver Point Capital. Earlier this month, it emerged that Thames Water may not fully comply with rules on pollution of England’s waterways for as long as 15 years, according to a new plan by creditors who are scrambling to avoid the utility being forced into government administration. The group of financial institutions, under the new London &amp; Valley Water holding company, has been locked in talks with Ofwat since May over acceptable terms for the hugely complex restructuring of Britain’s biggest water company. Thames Water has been crippled by huge debts built up over two decades by owners who have been criticised for paying out dividends without investing enough in its leaking pipes and malfunctioning treatment works, leading to repeated sewage spills into Britain’s rivers and seas, and fines from the regulator. The co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry’s has accused its owner of being part of a movement of “corporate butt kissing” of Donald Trump and says management blocked the ice-cream brand from producing a flavour in support of peace in Gaza. Ben Cohen told the Guardian that Unilever was pursuing a “corporate attack on free speech” by blocking the development of a special flavour in solidarity with the Palestinian people. It is understood the flavour had been approved by Ben &amp; Jerry’s independent board and first mooted about a year ago. Magnum, the group’s ice-cream arm, confirmed it had not gone ahead with the board’s suggestion for a Palestine product this summer. Cohen has mounted a “Free Ben &amp; Jerry’s” campaign to persuade Unilever to sell the brand to a group of socially minded investors who he says have pledged to allow it to continue its “social mission.” With an increasingly authoritarian Trump in the White House, Cohen says now is the time that “companies and anyone who believes in justice, freedom and peace stands up. This is the moment when it is most needed for Ben &amp; Jerry’s to be able to raise its voice. “It seems like since Trump got elected anything that Trump is against, DEI, black history, protesters’ rights to free speech, all those things got censored.” Previous Ben &amp; Jerry’s flavours with an activist bent have included “Save Our Swirled” to highlight the need for action at the 2015 Paris climate meetings, “I Dough, I Dough” to celebrate the legalisation of same-sex marriage at a US federal level, and “Home Sweet Honeycomb” in support of resettling refugees in Europe. Cohen’s criticisms are the latest blow in the acrimonious spat between the brand’s founders and owners. Unilever is planning to spin off the Magnum Ice Cream Company into a separate business, which it hopes to list in Amsterdam with secondary listings in London and New York. Those plans were this week delayed because of the US government shutdown, although they could proceed by the end of the year. Unilever said remained confident of implementing its demerger plans this year. BT is reportedly considering the launch of new a low-cost mobile brand, as the telecoms group explores ways to compete with new rivals in the market including the fintech companies Revolut and Monzo. The group is exploring options to enter the budget market, which could involve creating a new brand in-house or buying an existing virtual network operator, according to the Financial Times. The move would mark a strategy shift from the former state-owned company, which now only offers mobile services through its premium EE brand. BT owns Plusnet, but decided last year to use the low-cost brand only for its broadband services. However, it is now looking at how it can stay competitive as new rivals, including from the fintech sector, start taking slices of the UK mobile market as virtual network operators, which piggyback on the existing networks of other mobile services. Asked whether higher spending on new drugs will require additional funding for the NHS, Vallance said yes. We’ve discussed the fact that if there’s a rise in price for innovative medicines, that comes with a cost load and that needs to be met. And I’ve described the percentage change of spend on medicines, and there’s an overall budget question, and that’s really for DHSC [department of health and social care] to to consider, how they’re going to deal with that. But I mean, yes there will be an increased cost. You can’t escape that. He stressed the importance of “getting the commercial environment right” or you won’t get medicines launched in the UK. It’s worth reflecting that if we’re in a situation where companies don’t want to sell their medicines in the UK, that’s not great for anybody. If you don’t get these things right, the commercial environment right,particularly in the era of comparative pricing going on in the US, then you don’t get medicines launched in the UK, patients suffer. So that’s why we have to get this price point, this ability to be competitive in the commercial arena, right at the same time as doing all the other things we’re doing on the life sciences plan. Earlier, Sam Roberts, the chief executive of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which assesses which new drugs should be offered on the NHS, said “91% of medicines that NICE looks at we say yes to”. So where does that put us? 91% puts us at sixth in Europe. So six out of 37 countries, top quarter. We’re not the best. We’re definitely not the worst, and there’s been no deterioration in that over the last five years. NICE has come under heavy criticism from drugmakers for keeping its cost effectiveness thresholds unchanged in recent decades, and ministers have acknowledged that they should be reviewed. Roberts defended the thresholds, saying Society thinks that we should pay more for severe disease than for non severe disease. So we were given some freedoms in 2022 that said we can pay about 20% to 70% more. For rare diseases… we’re allowed to pay three to 10 times more. Steve Bates, executive chairman of the Office for Life Sciences, said “a good US deal” would “quickly resolve” the issue of a lack of confidence of big pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca and MSD in the UK, and its impact on investment decisions. Quizzed by MPs on the science committee, Bates, who took up his new job at OLS in September after running the BioIndustry Association for 13 years, said: So I think a good deal with the USA can quickly resolve it, is the simple answer for that. I’m saying that if the UK can get a fantastic domestic business environment allied to access to global markets, that’s a fantastic base from which any companies would want to grow for the world. MSD, known as Merck in the US, AstraZeneca and other big pharma companies have scrapped or paused investments in the UK, while ramping up investments in the US. The UK head of Novartis called Britain “largely uninvestable” as negotiations between the industry and UK government over a new pricing agreement broke down in late August. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has been putting pressure on drugmakers to invest more in the US, and to cut drug prices, or face trade tariffs. This means any UK decisions on higher drug pricing and NHS spending are tied to a deal with the US. Varun Chandra, business adviser to Keir Starmer, has been leading negotiations with officials in Washington. Science minister Patrick Vallance, a former GSK executive, said in front of the same committee that “some degree of price increase is inevitable in the UK,” referring to higher NHS spending on new medications that the pharma industry has long called for. I think for brand new, innovative medicines, it’s likely there will be some price increase. If you go back to 2015 the spend on medicines was about 12% [of total NHS spending] if you go back earlier, it was higher, it was about 14%. It’s now about 9%. So there is a possibility of increasing percentage spend. European shares have eased from all-time highs, after the UK and Spanish stock markets hit new peaks. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index dipped by 0.35% after its third consecutive record closing high, as traders were cheered by Donald Trump’s optimism over a trade deal with China. He is due to meet Chinese president Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday. A trade truce between the two countries is set to expire on 1 November, which could bring higher US tariffs and Chinese curbs on rare earth exports, unless a deal is struck before then. The FTSE 100 index rose to a new record high in early trading as did Spain’s Ibex but are now broadly flat. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: Results from some of the big names which dominate the US market will likely dictate whether the market can extend its recent momentum into November, as will the Federal Reserve’s latest decision on interest rates tomorrow. A cut is widely expected but, with most US data releases paused thanks to the shutdown in Washington, the Federal Reserve’s ability to make an informed decision is impaired. Rachel Reeves has expressed confidence that a trade deal with Gulf countries can be done quickly, saying she had “really good” meetings in Riyadh. “I am really confident we can get that deal over the line,” she said at Saudi Arabia’s flagship investment summit held in the Saudi capital, adding she was hopeful that the agreement could be reached “very soon”. The chancellor hopes to deepen the UK’s relationship with a state that has been widely criticised for human rights abuses. Reeves, who is the first UK chancellor to visit the region in six years, wants to use the trip to speak with her counterparts from Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar to advance a trade deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a six-nation group. British administrations have sought to reach an agreement with the GCC after Britain left the European Union in 2020. Reeves is also expected to meet senior Saudi royals, members of Donald Trump’s administration and business figures while in Saudi Arabia. Last year Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund bought a 15% stake in London’s Heathrow Airport from Spanish construction company Ferrovial, and Britain expects further investment announcements this week. New state-owned airline Riyadh Air, which ordered 25 partly British-built Airbus A350 aircraft in June, has announced its inaugural flight will be to Heathrow. Trade minister Chris Bryant told parliament this month that talks with the GCC were at “an advanced stage”, despite concerns from trade unions close to the Labour Party about poor rights for workers and other perceived abuses in the region. The Treasury estimates a Gulf trade deal would add £1.6bn a year to UK economic output - equivalent to about 0.06% of annual gross domestic product. The Treasury said on Sunday that Reeves would be “honest over areas of divergence and cultural differences” during her conversations with her Gulf counterparts. Here’s our full story: Rachel Reeves will have to account for a bigger-than-expected £20bn hit to the public finances in next month’s budget, the Guardian understands, as the Treasury’s forecaster prepares to cut predictions for UK productivity. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is planning to cut its trend productivity growth prediction by 0.3 percentage points, in a move that increases the likelihood of the chancellor announcing tax rises on 26 November. Reeves told the Fortune Forum in Saudi Arabia on Monday: Our independent forecaster is likely to downgrade the forecast for productivity in the UK based not on anything this government has done, but on our past productivity numbers, which, to be honest, since the financial crisis and Brexit have been very poor, and that just shows how essential growth is. So I’m not going to do anything in the budget that reduces our opportunities to grow the economy. That’s very important. The estimated impact is based on calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank, first reported in the Financial Times, which has said that each 0.1-percentage-point downgrade to productivity would increase public sector net borrowing by £7bn in 2029-30. That suggests that a 0.3-point reduction could result in a £21bn hit to the public finances. Some analysts had been forecasting a 0.1 to 0.2-point downgrade in the OBR’s productivity outlook, resulting in smaller hit to the public finances of between £7bn and £14bn, based on IFS calculations. This would result in a total fiscal hole of £20bn to £30bn, according to some estimates. A larger downgrade to productivity by the OBR would increase that shortfall. However, the final number could be offset by other factors including lower borrowing costs and faster-than-expected growth. Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker GSK has struck another deal to bolster its pipeline of medicines, a day before announcing its quarterly results, the last presented by outgoing chief executive Emma Walmsley. The company has acquired a treatment for COPD, a severe lung disease, that is in early clinical studies, from the Californian biotech Empirico. GSK said the drug’s novel mechanism of action, discovered by Empirico, targets a distinct inflammatory pathway introducing the potential for a therapeutic approach that is agnostic of baseline type 2 inflammation, smoking or co-morbid disease. The target is backed by extensive genetic data. Kaivan Khavandi, global head of respiratory, immunology &amp; inflammation research &amp; development at GSK, said: This agreement reflects our ambition to transform care in COPD by advancing novel targets, backed by data, to address underlying drivers of disease. With its expected long-acting characteristics and ability to target distinct inflammatory pathways, EMP-012 complements our pipeline of diverse modalities in COPD and builds on the current landscape of inhaled and biologic therapeutics in this area of substantial unmet need. GSK will pay $85m upfront and up to $660m in success-based development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties on sales worldwide. Yesterday, GSK struck a deal for a prostate cancer medication from a French biotech firm. Separately, the pharma firm’s treatment for small-cell lung cancer has received orphan drug designation in the EU, as it addresses a significant unmet need for an aggressive form of lung cancer with poor outcomes and limited treatment options, GSK said. The status, awarded to medicines for rare conditions, means the drug can benefit from incentives such as protection from competition once on the market. Toothpaste, coffee and even heartburn medicine are among the latest products quietly shrinking in size while shoppers pay the same price, piling more pressure on household grocery budgets. Consumer watchdog Which? found a range of new examples of shrinkflation as brands cut back on quantity and quality in an effort to reduce their own costs. One of the worst instances was Aquafresh complete care original toothpaste, which went from £1.30 for 100ml to £2 for 75ml at Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Ocado – a 105% increase per 100ml. Haleon Great Britain and Ireland, which was spun off from GSK three years ago and owns the Aquafresh brand, told the Guardian: We understand that people across the UK are facing pressure on their finances. Prices go up and down for a variety of reasons, and we always work hard for people to receive the highest quality products at the lowest price so that the whole family can take care of their teeth. Gaviscon heartburn and indigestion liquid shrank from 600ml to 500ml, with Sainsbury’s keeping the price at £14 – equivalent to a 20% increase per 100ml. They did not respond to a request for comment. Nescafé original instant coffee was cut from 200g to 190g at Tesco, Morrisons and Asda – about a 5% rise per 100g. A Nestlé spokesperson said: Like every manufacturer, we have seen significant increases in the cost of coffee, making it much more expensive to manufacture our products … Retail pricing is always at the discretion of individual retailers. Chocolate has also been hit by rising cocoa prices, with Quality Street tubs reduced from 600g to 550g and prices at Morrisons increasing from £6 to £7 – a 27% rise per 100g. Club and Penguin biscuits, both made by McVitie’s, can no longer be described as chocolate biscuits, as they now contain more palm oil and shea oil than cocoa, a change first reported by trade journal The Grocer. The TUC has warned that more than 2 million workers would be denied protection from unfair dismissal if a six-month qualifying period was implemented before those rights kick in. The employment rights bill is designed to ensure workers are protected from being sacked unfairly from day one in the job. It will also ban exploitative zero-hours contracts by giving workers a right to a contract which reflects their regular hours. But it is being delayed by a series of amendments by Tory and Lib Dem peers, including one that would provide a loophole for workers to be denied a guaranteed hours contract and another that would introduce a qualifying period of 6 months for protection from unfair sackings. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said Lords blocking the Bill should “step aside” so government can deliver its flagship workers’ rights bill that will improve the lives of millions of workers – a key manifesto commitment at the last election. The TUC warns some in the business community – and on the opposition benches - are “willfully misrepresenting” the policy, and says employers can still have probation periods for staff, but they just won’t be able to sack staff unfairly. The UK domestic airline Eastern Airways has suspended operations and all of its flights have been cancelled, as it teetered on the brink administration, putting jobs at risk. The move affects hundreds of thousands of passengers. Customers of the airline, which operated regional services from airports across the UK, are urged not to go to the airport as flights will not be operating, the UK Civil Aviation Authority said. The airline served different destinations in England and Scotland, including Aberdeen, Humberside, Gatwick, Newquay, Teesside International and Wick John O’Groats, according to its website. On Monday morning the company filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator at the insolvency and companies court within the high court. Selina Chadha, consumer and markets director at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: We urge passengers planning to fly with this airline not to go to the airport as all Eastern Airways flights are cancelled. Eastern Airways customers should visit the Civil Aviation Authority’s website for the latest information. Here’s more on HSBC. HSBC has reported a 14% drop in third quarter profits to $7.3bn (£5.5bn), as it took a dual hit from both a real estate downturn in Hong Kong, and a lawsuit over the Bernard Madoff ponzi scheme. It came as the London-based bank reported a 24% jump in operating costs to $10.1bn, which included restructuring costs - severance for bankers let go as part of the process - linked to a major shake-up under chief executive Georges Elhedery announced last year. But those operating costs also reflected a $1.1bn provision to cover a lawsuit by investors who lost money in the Madoff ponzi scheme. It comes after a Luxembourg court turned down HSBC’s appeal. Madoff admitted in 2009 to defrauding thousands of investors, losing them $65bn (£48.8bn). He died in prison in 2021. HSBC has been battling a 2009 lawsuit against its Luxembourg arm, with investors trying to recoup losses from the fraud. HSBC said it plans to file a further appeal with the Luxembourg Court of Appeal and, if that fails, it will dispute the final amount in later proceedings. HSBC also put aside another $1bn to deal with the ripple effects of China and Hong Kong’s real estate downturn, which has hit the banking sector, with a rise in bad debts linked to the crash in property prices. Chief executive Georges Elhedery said: We are becoming a simple, more agile, focused bank, built on our core strengths. The intent with which we are executing our strategy is reflected in our performance this quarter, despite taking legal provisions related to historical matters. He added: We remain fully focused on helping our customers navigate new economic realities, putting their changing needs at the heart of everything we do. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The chancellor faces a bigger-than-expected hit to the public finances of around £20bn, because of poor productivity in the UK economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government’s official forecaster, is expected to cut its trend productivity growth prediction by 0.3 percentage points, the Financial Times reported. It is expected to deliver its forecasts to Rachel Reeves on Friday, and they will be published on budget day on 26 November. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank has said that each 0.1 percentage point downgrade to productivity would increase public sector net borrowing by £7bn in 2029-30, so a 0.3 point reduction could create a £21bn hit. Analysts have been expecting a smaller downgrade to productivity that would result in a £7bn to £14bn fiscal hit under the IFS calculation. This would result in a total fiscal hole of £20bn to £30bn according to analysts’ estimates. A larger-than-expected productivity downgrade would increase the size of that hole, but the final number could be offset by other factors. A bigger hit from worse productivity would make Rachel Reeves’ job much harder. She hinted at the downgrade on Monday, saying productivity was “poor” and blamed the financial crisis and Brexit. Speaking to business leaders in Saudi Arabia, she said: Our independent forecaster is likely to downgrade the forecast for productivity in the UK, based not on anything this government has done but on our past productivity numbers, which, to be honest, since the financial crisis and Brexit, have been very poor. Poor productivity has long been a problem for the UK economy, to be fair. The mooted downgrade will increase expectations that the chancellor will be forced to breach Labour’s election manifesto pledge on tax, with speculation around an income tax hike in the budget. Meanwhile, HSBC has reported a 14% drop in third quarter profits, as it took a dual hit from a real estate downturn in Hong Kong, and a lawsuit over the Bernard Madoff ponzi scheme. Pre-tax profits at the London-headquartered bank fell to $7.3bn in the three months to September 30, down from $8.5bn during the same period last year (more later).

The new iPad Air M3 costs from £599 (€699/$599/A$999) – the same as its predecessor – and comes in two sizes with either an 11in or 13in screen. It sits between the base-model £329 iPad A16 and the £999 iPad Pro M4, splitting the difference in price and features. Nothing has changed on the outside of the tablet. The M3 model is a straight replacement for the M2 model, featuring the same crisp screen, sleek aluminium design and Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button. The Centre Stage webcam at the top of the screen makes video calls a breeze by automatically panning and scanning to keep you and your family in frame. Stereo speakers make watching TV and films great, while support for the £129 Apple Pencil Pro makes doodling or taking notes a joy. Specifications Screen: 11in or 13in Liquid Retina display (264ppi) Processor: Apple M3 (9-core GPU) RAM: 8GB Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: iPadOS 18.4 Camera: 12MP rear, 12MP centre stage Connectivity: Wifi 6E (5G optional eSim-only), Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Touch ID, Smart Connecter Dimensions: 247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm or 280.6 x 214.9 x 6.1mm Weight: 460g or 616g M3 upgrade and solid battery life The big change for the new Air is an upgrade to the Apple M3 chip, which was first seen in late 2023 in the MacBook Pro and was successfully used in the MacBook Air until March when it was replaced with the M4 chip. While the M3 isn’t Apple’s latest chip, it is still far more powerful than most will ever need in a tablet and much faster than the competition. It is about 10-20% quicker than the outgoing M2 model in tests and will make short work of games and even pro-level apps such as Affinity Photo, Procreate or Adobe Lightroom. Combined with a reliable battery life of nine to 10 hours, it can easily be used as a laptop replacement when equipped with accessories such as the new version of Apple’s excellent Magic Keyboard case, although that comes at great cost at £269. Cheaper third-party options from Logitech and others are available, however. The iPad Air runs iPadOS 18.4, which includes a collection of multitasking tools, and can be plugged into an external monitor such as a laptop via the USB-C port. But the M3 chip also enables various Apple Intelligence features, which are not available on the standard iPad A16. These include several AI image editing and generation tools, writing and proofreading tools, ChatGPT integration into Siri and other bits. Sustainability Apple says the battery should last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity, and can be replaced from £115. The tablet is generally repairable, with a damaged out-of-warranty repair costing from £429. The tablet contains at least 30% recycled content, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. Apple breaks down the tablet’s environmental impact in its report and offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The 11in iPad Air M3 costs from £599 (€699/$599/A$999) and the 13in iPad Air M3 costs from £799 (€949/$799/A$1,349). For comparison, the iPad A16 costs from £329, the iPad Pro M4 costs from £999 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE costs from £499. The MacBook Air M4 starts at £999. Verdict The iPad Air M3 is a great premium tablet that makes for an excellent upgrade over the base model Apple tablet. It is a highly capable machine with laptop-level power, long battery life, a quality screen and plenty of accessories to turn it into a drawing tablet, computer replacement or many other tools. The choice of sizes balances nicely between portability at the 11in and the big-screen utility of the 13in version. But the M3 model isn’t an upgrade worth making over recent iPad Air versions, and if all you do is watch TV or films on it, the standard iPad A16 does the job for much less. Meanwhile, the top-end iPad Pro M4 beats the Air on all counts but costs an awful lot more. So for those looking for a premium do-it-all tablet, the iPad Air M3 is hard to beat. Pros: choice of sizes, laptop-level M3 performance, solid battery life, quality screen, USB-C, long software support life, large range of apps and accessories, good speakers, landscape Centre Stage camera, recycled aluminium. Cons: expensive, no multiuser support, iPadOS still needs work as a laptop replacement, no kickstand without case, no Face ID, 60Hz screen.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}

It’s a clever (and delicious) trick. Apple and rhubarb crumb bars The apple filling should be made in advance (up to two days), giving it plenty of time to cool before being spooned over the base. Serve these bars on their own with tea, or warm with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream for a sweet finish to a feast. Prep 15 min Macerate 30 min+ Cook 2 hr 10 min, plus cooling Serves 8-12 For the apple filling 1½kg apples (4 large granny smiths and 4 large pink ladys), peeled, cored and cut into ½cm-thick pieces (1kg net) 80g caster sugar 2 tbsp lemon juice 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar 1 tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground nutmeg ⅛ tsp fine sea salt 2 tbsp unsalted butter 2½ tsp cornflour 200g rhubarb, cut into 1cm pieces, or whole blackberries Icing sugar, for dusting For the pastry 400g plain flour 150g caster sugar, plus 70g for the meringue Finely grated zest of 1 lemon 1 tsp baking powder ¼ tsp fine sea salt 180g unsalted butter, cold and cut into 6-8 pieces, plus 10g, softened, for greasing 4 eggs; 1 whole, 3 separated 1 tsp vanilla extract Put the apples, sugar, lemon juice, vinegar, spices and salt into a large bowl and toss to combine. Set aside to macerate at room temperature, tossing occasionally, for at least 30 minutes (and up to two hours). Strain the apples, reserving the juice in a jug – you should have about 100ml (top up with water if you’re short). Put a large saute pan over a medium heat and add one tablespoon of butter and half the strained apples. Cook, tossing regularly, for about 10 minutes, until the apples begin to soften. Tip them into a bowl and repeat with the remaining butter and raw apples. When the second batch of apples has softened, return the first batch to the pan. Whisk the cornflour into the reserved strained juice then stir into the pan. Cook for a minute until the juices thicken, then scrape the apples into a bowl. Stir in the rhubarb/blackberries and leave to cool completely. For the pastry, put the flour, 150g sugar, lemon zest, baking powder and salt in a food processor and pulse to combine and aerate. Add 180g butter and pulse again until it’s barely visible. Whisk the whole egg, yolks and vanilla together, then stream into the food processor, pulsing until the pastry starts to come together. Tip out on to a clean bench and knead gently to bring it together. Roll into a fat log, then slice it into two pieces, one weighing about 500g and the other 300g. Put the smaller log into the fridge. Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½ and grease a deep baking tray of about 33cm x 23cm x 4cm with the extra 10g softened butter. Slice the larger pastry log into 1cm-thick discs and lay in one layer on the base of the baking tray. Press the pastry together to form an even layer, then spoon the cooled fruit filling on top. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the whisk attachment on medium-high until soft peaks form. Drizzle in 70g caster sugar and continue whisking until firm peaks form. Spoon the mixture on top of the apple layer, and level with a small spatula. Remove the smaller pastry log from the fridge and crumble it evenly the meringue layer (you could also grate it on the large holes of a box grater). Bake for one hour, covering loosely with foil if the pastry gets too dark. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes, before slicing into large squares. Dust liberally with icing sugar and serve with cream or ice-cream. Spiced chocolate and hazelnut pudding with amaretto whipped cream Here, I’ve infused the pudding with the warm spices of hot cross buns and paired it with an alcohol-spiked cream for an indulgent finish to an Easter feast. The ingredients list looks long, I know, but rest assured it is simple to make. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 6 60g unsalted butter, plus 10g extra, softened, for greasing 120g self-raising flour ¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda 15g cocoa powder 1 tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground ginger ¼ tsp ground nutmeg ⅛ tsp ground allspice ⅛ tsp ground cloves ¼ tsp fine sea salt 60g finely ground blanched hazelnuts 100g dark chocolate (70%), roughly chopped 70g caster sugar Finely grated zest of 1 orange 120ml milk 1 tsp vanilla extract For the topping 80g light brown sugar 10g cocoa powder, plus extra for dusting A pinch of fine sea salt 300ml very hot water from a recently boiled kettle For the serving cream 300ml double cream 1 tbsp icing sugar 1 tbsp Amaretto or dark rum (optional) Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½ and grease the base and sides of a deep ovenproof dish (about 22cm in diameter) with the 10g softened butter. Sift the flour, bicarb, cocoa powder, spices and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the ground hazelnuts, stir well to combine, then set aside. Put the chocolate and butter in a small bowl and put over a small pan of barely simmering water, making sure that the base of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir occasionally until melted, then remove from the heat. Add the sugar and orange zest, whisk gently to combine, then add the milk and vanilla extract. Whisk again to incorporate, then pour the mix into the dry ingredients. Stir until fully combined (it will be quite thick), then scrape the batter into the buttered dish and level the surface with a small spatula. For the topping, put the brown sugar, cocoa powder and salt into a small bowl and whisk to combine. Scatter this mixture evenly on top of the pudding to cover in a thick layer, then carefully spoon the hot water all over the top. Bake for about 35 minutes, until the pudding forms a slightly crusty, shiny top and the centre springs back when tapped lightly. Meanwhile, put all the ingredients for the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the whisk attachment on medium speed until soft waves form. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Remove the pudding from the oven and while the sauce is still molten, sieve a little cocoa powder on top, then bring to the table. Scoop large spoonfuls into serving bowls and serve with the whipped cream on the side.

The company’s thinnest and lightest laptop currently starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,699) – £100 less than last year’s model – and has Apple’s top M4 chip with a minimum of 16GB of memory, making the cheapest model much more capable. Nothing has changed since 2022 on the outside other than a fetching new light blue colour that replaces the longstanding “space grey”. The aluminium body is just as well made, thin and light. The keyboard is excellent, the Touch ID fingerprint reader in the power button is fast and the generous trackpad is best in class. The 13.6in LCD screen is crisp and good, although limited to 60Hz, unlike the faster and smoother screen on the MacBook Pro line and some rivals. New for this year is an upgraded webcam, which is now 12 megapixels and sports Apple’s Centre Stage tech for automatic panning and scanning, plus support for Desk View for demonstrating things remotely, similar to the M4 MacBook Pro. Two meaningful changes have been made on the inside. The new M4 chip makes the Air essentially as fast as the MacBook Pro, which is to say very fast and snappy indeed. In tests it is only marginally slower than the Pro despite not having a fan to keep it cool for prolonged periods, and faster than the iPad Pro with M4 chip. There is little the Air will not be able to manage outside workstation-class workloads. Note the cheapest model has two fewer graphics cores on its chip, which will make it slightly less powerful for certain apps and games. All Airs now also come with at least 16GB of memory, which is the recommended minimum amount for modern laptops. The previous model started with only 8GB of memory, which cost £200 to double. Along with powerful chips, the Air’s main selling point – very long battery life – remains. For general light workloads using browsers, notes apps, word processing, image editing, chats and emails, the Air regularly lasts more than 16 hours between charges, which is roughly two full work days on battery. Pushed a bit harder, such as developing and editing photos, the Air still managed more than 10 hours’ work on battery. Specifications Screen: 13.6in LCD (2560x1600; 224 ppi) True Tone Processor: Apple M4 with eight or 10-core GPU RAM: 16, 24 or 32GB Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB SSD Operating system: macOS 15 Sequoia Camera: 12MP Centre Stage Connectivity: wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 2x Thunderbolt/USB 4, headphones Dimensions: 215 x 304.1 x 11.3mm Weight: 1.24kg Sustainability The MacBook Air is made with 55% recycled materials including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare-earth elements, steel and tin. Apple breaks down the computer’s environmental impact in its report. The computer is generally repairable, and the battery can be replaced for £159 by Apple. The repair specialists iFixit gave the machine five out of 10 for repairability. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. macOS Sequoia 15.4 The Air runs the same macOS Sequoia software as the rest of the Mac lineup, recently updated to version 15.4, which brings with it a few more Apple Intelligence features. The Mac Mail app has been redesigned to more closely resemble the app on an iPhone with AI email categorisation, such as promotional emails, receipts and others. AI notification summaries are useful, as is iPhone mirroring if you also use an Apple smartphone. The new snapping and window tiling tools are very handy, allowing you to quickly arrange your windows with either mouse or keyboard shortcuts, something that previously required third-party tools. Price The Apple 13in MacBook Air starts at £999 (€1,199/$999/A$1,699) with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. 15in versions start at £1,199 (€1,499/$1,199/A$2,099). For comparison, the M4 MacBook Pro starts at £1,599, the Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Edge costs £1,399 and the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 starts at £1,049. Verdict The MacBook Air is the consumer laptop to beat unless you specifically need Windows. It simply offers a better combination of performance, battery life, speakers, keyboard and trackpad than rivals. The M4 chip upgrade keeps it ahead of the pack while being fanless and therefore silent at all times. The new Centre Stage webcam is a huge improvement, too, for anyone who lives on video calls for work. The screen is still great, although this is one area where better displays can be found on competitors at higher cost. It only has two USB-C ports but at least it can be charged via the MagSafe port to keep them available for connections. A price cut to about £1,000 or equivalent for the 13in model is very welcome, as is the minimum of 16GB of memory, which makes the 2025 MacBook Air surprisingly good value for a premium notebook. Pros: super-fast M4 chip, silent and cool running, extremely long battery life, good 13.6in screen, great keyboard, best-in-class trackpad, MagSafe, good speakers, Centre Stage webcam, Touch ID. Cons: only two USB-C ports and no USB-A or SD card slot, no Face ID, RAM and SSD upgrades are expensive and cannot be changed after purchase, no wifi 7.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Apple", "companies": ["Apple"]}

Titi monkeys swing in the treetops as the Mocoa River roars nearby. For four years, he and his family have lived quietly in this biodiverse “gateway to the Amazon”, where the Andes descend into the rainforest, home to mountain tapirs, spectacled bears and vital rivers. But Portillo, 46, fears this peaceful landscape is at risk. Canadian company Copper Giant Resources has been exploring nearby mountains with a view to opening one of Colombia’s largest copper mines. Beneath Mocoa lie an estimated 2m tonnes of copper, a transition metal vital for clean energy in wind turbines and batteries. Copper Giant holds four permits for the exploration and possible development of copper and molybdenum, and has expanded its land in Mocoa to more than 136,000 hectares (337,000 acres) by acquiring Grupo Minera Sol in June, a Colombian company that holds 12 mining applications covering 53,474 hectares (132,000 acres). “We’re surrounded by nature and the air you breathe is pure,” says Portillo. “What we fear is that all of this would be destroyed, completely finished.” As the world strives toward a carbon-free future, demand for copper has soared. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) thinktank, copper prices reached a high of $10,800 (£8,000) a tonne last year, while demand is projected to grow by 30% by 2040. Supplies have not kept pace, with the IEA predicting a 30% shortfall by 2035, and Colombia’s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro, has prioritised securing minerals crucial to the energy transition, including copper. But critics say the push to extract copper in Mocoa risks undermining another of Petro’s promises: preserving the Amazon. Mocoa sits along the Cauca metallogenic belt, a stretch of the Andes known to be rich with minerals, and at the edge of the Amazon rainforest. Efforts to develop a mine in the area have long faced resistance from local people, who believe that such a project would cause irreversible damage to the fragile ecosystems and pollute the waters on which they rely. In March, residents of Pueblo Viejo, near the exploration area, protested over a road to the site. What started as demands for Copper Giant to fix the road turned into a 47-day blockade, demanding that the government stop mining. Since then, residents have established a “resistance camp” and barred company vehicles during working hours. Signs reading “water is more valuable than copper” and “land, water and life are non-negotiable” are on display. “We’re speaking out because we want people to realise we can protect mountains and countryside before it’s too late,” Portillo says. In May, CorpoAmazonia, the regional environmental authority, and the environment ministry reached a deal with protesters to review the viability of the mining project. By early June, the authority issued a resolution designating 93,000 hectares (230,000 acres), including land within the mining concessions, as an “area of ecological importance”, where mining activities would be restricted. Although the resolution is non-binding, it has increased pressure on the national government. “What we want to avoid is the displacement and extinction of flora and fauna species and also to avoid the contamination of water sources,” says a CorpoAmazonia official, speaking anonymously as they were not authorised to comment publicly. The official says the report notes the mining concession overlaps with the protective forest reserve of the upper Mocoa River basin, a conservation area that is home to more than 350 species of flora and fauna and serves as a critical water source for local communities. He also warned that the use of explosives and heavy metals in copper extraction endangers the integrity of the protected area and other fragile ecosystems, such as the water-generating páramos (tropical Andean wetland grassland ecosystems), that are located within the mining concessions. *** Copper Giant says the project in Colombia is still in the early stages of exploration, a phase that could last another eight to 10 years, and that it is too early to determine the environmental impacts of copper mining in the area. “We don’t even have a design for the mine yet,” says Thyana Álvarez, Copper Giant country manager. Álvarez adds that last year, the company requested that Colombia’s National Mining Agency excluded the forest reserve areas from its mining concessions. “We are awaiting the new concession contracts with these removals,” she says. Still, the dispute in Mocoa has highlighted tensions within Petro’s environmental agenda. In 2023, the president announced a shift away from oil and gas exploration and ordered the exploration of energy transition materials. That same year, his administration classified 17 minerals, copper among them, as “strategic” for their role in the country’s energy transition. “I have asked the energy minister to focus mining exploration on fundamental raw materials so that Colombia can become an enormous generator of clean energy,” Petro said in 2023. But critics have said the rush to extract minerals critical to the energy transition could come at the cost of the Amazon rainforest, considered a vital carbon sink essential for the fight against the climate emergency. About 40% of Colombia’s territory is part of the Amazon region. José Luis López, a researcher at the National University’s Observatory of Environmental Conflict in Bogotá, says Colombia’s climate crisis strategy would be more effective if it focused on “conserving biodiversity and halting forest degradation” rather than expanding mining. In May, the environment minister, Lena Estrada, publicly addressed the protests in Mocoa, noting that the ministry is reviewing local calls for stricter protection. “They’re asking for environmental zoning of those territories,” she said. “We’re going to review this possibility. We’re going to make the province of Putumayo [where Mocoa is located], like all the other Amazonian provinces, protected areas.” The national mining agency did not respond to a request for comment. In Pueblo Viejo, Portillo and others remain suspicious and continue to voice their opposition. They hold resistance camp meetings and have launched a campaign to create awareness among the surrounding communities about the impact a mine could have. Portillo says that he will continue until Copper Giant leaves their territory. “We refuse,” he says, “to be sacrificed for the energy transition.”", "section": "Global development", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

About 540 square miles of land have been cleared for mining in the South American country since 1984, and the environmental destruction is spreading rapidly across the country, Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) and its Peruvian partner organisation, Conservación Amazónica, found. The gold rush is also poisoning its waterways. Illegal miners use dredges – floating machines that chew up and spit out riverbeds – leaving the toxic mercury used to extract gold from sediment in their wake. Ultra-high resolution aerial images allowed MAAP, part of Amazon Conservation, to identify dredges alongside deforestation for the first time, enabling them to identify goldminers and revealing that the environmental crisis once confined to the south of the country was creeping north. “We used to only see it in the Madre de Dios region but now we’re seeing it everywhere”, said MAAP’s director, Matt Finer. The price of gold topped $4,000 for the first time this week on the international markets as global anxiety increased about financial fragility. Indigenous groups have sounded the alarm that as the price of soars, armed groups were increasingly tearing down their forests and poisoning their rivers in pursuit of the precious metal. MAAP’s aerial images show that once dense swathes of green jungle are being transformed into lifeless moonscapes of grey earth pocked with stagnant pools of green water. “This little square is just a tiny sample,” Finer says, pointing to a small section of the vast red patchwork of deforestation mapped in the report. “Imagine this multiplied to 140,000 hectares.” The mercury residues build up in fish and pass to the people who eat them, leading to neurological and developmental problems such as birth defects and learning difficulties. A recent study of riverside communities in Peru’s northernmost region of Loreto found the median level of mercury was nearly four times the World Health Organization’s recommended limit. MAAP’s analysis found that 225 rivers and streams have been affected, with 989 dredges spotted in Loreto since 2017 – including 275 this year alone on the Nanay River, a tributary of the Amazon that is the lifeblood of ecosystems and dozens of Indigenous communities. “They are poisoning our rivers – it’s the water that we drink,” said Roberto Tafur Shupingahua, a representative of several riverside communities in Loreto. Shupingahua said local communities began blocking miners from advancing up the River Tigre in Loreto 40 days ago, leading to gunfights with armed intruders. “We have no choice but to fight back but we are alone. The state is nowhere to be seen,” he said, his voice raising in anger. Mining remains concentrated in the Madre de Dios region in southern Peru but new hotspots are emerging farther north in Loreto, Amazonas, Huánuco, Pasco and Ucayali. They are small but once mining is established it could expand quickly, Finer said, adding that the report was a glimpse into what was happening across the rest of the Amazon. “This is the first time we’ve been able to look in this detail at a country but I think in Brazil, Bolivia and Colombia we are going to see exactly the same thing,” he said. MAAP’s report showed more dredges appearing on Peru’s jungle frontiers with Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia. With gold prices surpassing $4,000 an ounce, foreign, armed groups are increasingly venturing across the border into Peru’s lawless jungles where local authorities are doing little to stop them, says Bram Ebus, a criminologist and consultant for the International Crisis Group. Criminal networks, including the Comandos de la Frontera from Colombia and Comando Vermelho from Brazil, are increasingly active across the border. “International crime networks trafficking cocaine and laundering profits through illegal gold mining – now with peak prices providing hefty returns – are combined with a government in Lima that has not been a serious obstacle against organised crime,” Ebus said. The Andean Group – a political coalition of South American countries – told Peru on Tuesday to get serious about illegal mining or it could face economic sanctions. But Finer said: “Gold is just so profitable right now. I don’t see any signs of prices going down, so it’s probably going to get worse before it gets better.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

Coming less than three months before Brazil hosts the Cop30 climate summit in Belém, the news has shocked conservation groups, who say it is now more important than ever that consumers, supermarkets and traders stand up against Brazilian agribusiness groups that are using their growing political power to reverse past environmental gains. Brazil is the world’s biggest soya bean exporter. The legume, used largely for animal and fish feed, is one of the most widely grown crops in Brazil, and posed a huge deforestation threat to the Amazon rainforest until stakeholders voluntarily agreed to impose a moratorium and no longer source it from the region in 2006. The voluntary agreement brought together farmers, environmentalists and international food companies such as Cargill and McDonald’s, and determined that any detection of soya beans planted on areas deforested after 2008 would result in the farm being blocked from supply chains, regardless of whether the land clearance was legal in Brazil. In the 19 years since, the moratorium has been hailed as a conservation success story that has improved the reputation of global brands, enabled soy production to expand significantly without Amazon destruction and prevented an estimated 17,000 sq km of deforestation. But earlier this week it was revealed that the anti-monopoly agency, Cade (the administrative council for economic defence) had given grain traders, such as Bunge, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus and Cofco, 10 days to suspend the moratorium or face financial penalties. Cade’s general superintendent, Alexandre Barreto de Souza, said he had instigated an investigation into the moratorium, noting that it involved sharing commercially sensitive information. Greenpeace Brazil called the move a “terrible mistake”, which was the result of political pressure from the “regressive wings of agribusiness” that aimed to punish those who protect forests and reward those who profit the most from Amazon destruction. “Without the soy moratorium, considered one of the most effective multi-stakeholder agreements in the world, soy will once again become a major driver of Amazon deforestation, and this will bury any chance of Brazil meeting its climate targets,” Cristiane Mazzetti, the group’s forest campaign coordinator, said. Politically, the timing could not be more embarrassing for the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In November, Brazil will stage the first climate conference to be held in the Amazon, which the hosts had hoped would be a showcase for the gains it has made in reducing deforestation. But in the Brazilian congress, the dominant agribusiness lobby has passed legislation that undermines indigenous land demarcation and the environmental licensing system, a step that conservation groups have described as the biggest setback in 40 years. The new ruling on the soy moratorium adds to the retreat. “Tearing up this agreement on the eve of the Cop30 climate talks sends completely the wrong signal to the world,” Tanya Steele, WWF-UK’s chief executive, said. “This is a perilous development that puts a decade-long agreement to protect the Amazon in the bin and would have a far-reaching impact on UK and global companies too. This suspension has to be reversed. After a summer of fires and extreme heat experienced right across the world, now more than ever we need to be safeguarding the Amazon.” Much of the political pressure has come from Mato Grosso state, the soya bean capital of Brazil, which last year revoked tax incentives for companies engaged in agreements such as the soy moratorium. Industry group Aprosoja Mato Grosso welcomed the “historic” decision against what it called “a private agreement without legal support [that] has been imposing unfair trade barriers on farmers”. David Cleary, a retired NGO director involved with the Amazon since the 1980s, says soya bean producers want more land to expand production and to increase the value of their assets in the Amazon. He estimates that about 10m hectares (25m acres) – about the size of Portugal – could be suitable for legal clearance for soya if the moratorium is revoked, pushing up the value of that land by fivefold. Many expect protracted legal challenges on the grounds that the moratorium cannot be considered a cartel. In the meantime, conservationists urge soya bean traders to continue with the principles of the moratorium on an individual basis for the sake of their international reputations. There is strong support among consumers for Amazon protection. A WWF poll earlier this year found 70% of Britons support government action to remove illegal deforestation from UK supply chains. “Consumers and retailers have a vital role to play,” said Bel Lyon of WWF-UK. “Market demand must not allow the profits of a few to fuel ecosystem collapse and price instability. Forests are essential for food and energy security, offering climate and health benefits in an increasingly unstable world.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

Scientists said the paper, published in Nature Plants on Thursday, was welcome confirmation that big trees are proving more climate resilient than previously believed, and undisturbed tropical vegetation continues to act as an effective carbon sink despite rising temperatures and strong droughts. However, the authors warned this vital role was increasingly at risk from fires, fragmentation and land clearance caused by the expansion of roads and farms. “It is good news but it is qualified good news,” said Prof Oliver Phillips from the University of Leeds. “Our results apply only to intact, mature forests, which is where we are watching closely. They suggest the Amazon forest is remarkably resilient to climate change. My fear is that may count for little, unless we can stop the deforestation itself.” This caution comes as Brazil plans to pave a major road – the BR-319 – through the central Amazon, close to one of the last regions that still has large areas of pristine forest. Bolivia also continues to clear trees at an alarming rate for soy plantations and cattle ranching. The study was conducted by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the UK and beyond, who examined changes in the forest at 188 plots in the Amazon over the past 30 years. They found the mean cross-section of trunks thickened by 3.3% per decade, with the greatest increase found in larger trees. This expansion was attributed to the rising amount of CO2 in the atmosphere as a result of the human-caused burning of gas, oil and coal. Big trees such as castanheiras (Brazil nut trees), sumaúmas (kapoks) and Angelim vermelho can rise up above 30 metres so they dominate the canopy and lead the competition among plants for the light, water and nutrients needed to photosynthesise CO2. The results highlight how the best-protected areas of the forest remain important allies in the struggle to stabilise the climate, though they alone are far from enough to deal with all of the extra carbon dioxide being pumped into the air globally by cars, factories and power stations. They also show the importance of preventing further deforestation. The areas of the Amazon that have been heavily fragmented by agribusiness and infrastructure – mostly in the south-east – have already shifted from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Big trees are more vulnerable to strong wind, fire and drought if they are isolated or left on the edge of a border between forest and cropland or pasture. For decades, it had been assumed that huge trees – even in dense forest – would die more quickly as temperatures rose, because they were thought to have relatively shallow roots compared with their size. But recent studies show that many have very thin roots that can suck water from much greater depths. It is not yet clear how mortality trends might have been affected by the severe drought of the past few years in much of the Amazon. One of the lead authors of the new paper, Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert from the University of Cambridge, said the big trees were disproportionately important to the functioning of the biome. Although they account for just 1% of the trees in the forest, they were responsible for 50% of the carbon cycling and storage, and probably a similar proportion of the water cycling. “Forests get much drier after big trees die. It alters the structure of the forest and it takes a long time to bounce back because the big trees take a long time to grow,” Esquivel-Muelbert said. “So it is a little bit hopeful that we find them increasing in size and number across the Amazon. There is some resilience there.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

The 3,568MW plant, built to provide power for 45 million people, released a muddy torrent that flooded his neighbourhood, forcing 120 families to evacuate. “The river has gone out of control. We used to know when it would flood and when it would dry up. Now nobody knows any more,” says Nascimento, a rancher. “What men call progress has killed our history.” His is a sad tale, but not uncommon in the Amazon, where public works driven by political ambition and economic upswing have replaced the wilderness with boom towns, highways, dams and farms. While these projects have brought paved roads, electricity and jobs, they have also caused upheaval through disorderly urbanisation, organised crime, rapid deforestation and climate disruption. Fuelled by undaunted farmers and pioneering crop science, the soya bean industry has spread deep into the Amazon, blanketing the land, filling silos, helping convert Brazil into the world’s leading exporter and propelling the country’s agribusiness-boosted GDP. Studies show that transport of soya beans and maize in the so-called Amazon arc – the infrastructure for hauling crops – grew 4.8% in the past year and by 288% in the past 10 years. As the agricultural belt expands, it is reshaping the map of the Amazonian environment, infrastructure, commerce, politics and livelihoods. Brazil is now one of the world’s most bounteous agricultural producers, driven by harvests in the Cerrado, or central scrublands, and more recently in the Amazon biome. Soya beans are now cultivated in 25 of Brazil’s 27 states and cover more than half the nation’s arable land, from the pampas to the equator. In the first five months of 2025, Brazil became the top soya bean exporter with 51.53m tonnes, a 4.93% increase from the same period of 2024. Nearly 80% of soya beans are used for livestock and aquaculture, as China, the main buyer, uses 85% for animal feed, linking rising global meat demand to Brazil’s expanding exports. Three decades ago, only four of the nine Amazonian states planted soya beans. Today, all nine do, helping to make the legume Brazil’s fastest-growing commodity. Mato Grosso, a huge state that straddles the Cerrado and the Amazon, is the nation’s top producer. In Rondônia, soya bean cultivation has more than doubled since 2019, as has the economy. Under increasing public pressure, traders and big producers of the beans signed a “soya moratorium” in 2006, committing to forgo buying and selling soya beans grown on Amazonian plots deforested after 2008. In 2023, the European Commission went further, not only banning the sale of soya beans – and six other commodity crops – harvested from recently cleared Amazonian lands, but also requiring buyers to prove their imports were deforestation-free. The good news for agribusiness is that the tighter restrictions have not curtailed productivity. According to the latest report on the Amazon soya bean moratorium, although 95.6% of the expansion occurred in areas that were already affected by human activity before 2008, 16% of the area used to grow soya beans in the Amazon was cleared after the ban, and cultivation in untouched forest nearly tripled from 2018 to 2023, reaching 250,000 hectares (620,000 acres). These figures used to be controversial in Brazil – a cause for celebration for large producers and denounced by environmentalists, who are preparing for Cop30, the critical UN climate conference in November. Amazonian growers, however, continued to grumble that the soya moratorium was too prohibitive and violated free enterprise. They claimed that the rule barred land clearing even when another law permitted it – under Brazil’s 2012 forestry code, Amazonian farms may deforest up to 20% of their property. Last year, three Amazonian governors, led by Rondônia’s Marcos Rocha, passed laws cancelling tax breaks to signatories of the moratorium, alleging the pact amounted to a soya cartel. They drew praise from local farmers, many of whom had been caught out clearing forest for planting. Brazil’s anti-monopoly authority, Cade, agreed and, on 18 August, suspended the moratorium on the grounds that it unfairly advantaged a few big traders and farmers over medium and small-scale soya bean producers. A federal judge promptly overruled the antitrust board, and reinstated the moratorium. But with the agricultural lobby flexing its muscles in Brasília, the quarrel is far from over. Even if the moratorium holds, risks to the rainforest and its inhabitants remain. *** Nascimento – Zé Pereira to friends and family – has a front-row seat watching the soya bean boom. After shuttling between cheap hotels for nearly a year, he resettled in a small villa 16 miles (25km) from Porto Velho. Though he is not at risk of losing another home, the retired 70-year-old has watched uneasily as the land around him is surrendered to soya beans. “They invaded our land,” says Nascimento. “But because we hadn’t built on our lot, they moved in, planted soya beans right up to the fence, and stayed.” The cash crop has encircled his neighbourhood, overrun a local cemetery and now stretches to the horizon. Some days, the air is so thick with clouds of herbicides and pesticides that he can taste it. First, there’s “the tingling sensation” in his face. Then comes “the dizziness” and “difficulty breathing”, he says. “It’s not just me. Everyone over here feels it.” To planters, this is the scent of progress. Although most soya bean farmers are opportunists rather than villains in Amazon predation, the European Commission has traced strong indirect links between clearcutting and soya sowing. This is the case in Mato Grosso, where mechanised farms typically take over spent pasture, displacing ranchers such as Nascimento into pristine areas of neighbouring Pará, in the eastern Amazon basin. That pattern also drives up the price of forested land, in the expectation of future gains once the trees are gone – “even though soya bean is planted years after”, the European Commission concluded. Critically, however, even if no more trees fall to farmers, expanding soya bean plantations fuel the lobby’s demands for bigger and better infrastructure to store and ship their harvest to international markets. Hence the clamour to lay more asphalt, dredge rivers, build bridges and ports, and put down rails to haul ever bigger loads over already strained Amazonian transport networks. Take the BR-364, the main highway connecting western Amazonia to ports on the Atlantic coast, where every harvest brings traffic to a standstill. “We see 3,000 to 4,000 soya [articulated truck] rigs a day pass through Porto Velho,” says Adélio Barofaldi, chief executive of Rovema, a logistics company in Rondônia. “We are talking about 200km of gridlock every day.” To ease bottlenecks, the federal government recently privatised part of the highway, with plans to duplicate a critical 60-mile stretch, tellingly nicknamed the “Agro North route”. All to the detriment of the wilderness. A study found that nearly 95% of Amazon deforestation in Brazil falls within 3 miles of highways. In the Colombian Amazon, 80% of forest clearance occurs within less than 5 miles of roads. But roads lead to more roads. A recent study comparing the knock-on effects of highways in tropical regions found that every mile of official “first-cut road” in the Amazon basin generated another 30 miles of secondary roads. And much more clearcutting and degradation happened around secondary tracks than official routes. Soya’s success in the Americas is a cautionary tale, says Sandro Dutra e Silva, an environmental historian at Goiás State University studying the Cerrado. “Tropical agriculture has been hailed as a miracle, transforming Brazil into a farming power,” he says. However, because the savanna sits on South America’s key aquifers, overproduction could disrupt watersheds and weather. “The risk is that this technological triumph might hypnotise people into destroying the Cerrado and Amazonia,” Dutra says. Alexandre Nepomuceno, head of soya bean research at Embrapa, Brazil’s national agricultural institute – which developed soya strains that thrived in the tropics, boosting the seed’s use in the Amazon – cautions against vilifying scientific achievement for policy shortcomings. He says the same enterprising scientific tradition that brought harvests to the equator can also help Amazonian growers tread more lightly on the land. Mariangela Hungria, a Brazilian soil microbiology expert, won the 2025 World Food prize for her research into strains of bacteria that suck nitrogen from the air and attach it to the roots of soya beans, all but eliminating the need to import costly petroleum-based fertilisers. Last year, such biological nitrogen fixation delivered Brazil a bumper crop, saved $25m (£18.5m) in imported fertiliser, and avoided emitting 230m tons of climate-warming carbon into the atmosphere. Nepomuceno says that cutting-edge research can show the way. Still, science alone cannot save the Amazon. According to him, that is a job for policymakers, lawmakers and the public authorities that make the rules and enforce the red lines. “Given that Brazil already has plenty of deforested areas,” Nepomuceno says, “we have no need of clearing more land to grow soya beans.” • This article was amended on 29 September 2025 to include additional context regarding the use of soya beans for animal and fish feed.", "section": "Global development", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

Prime Vision will offer a version of broadcast coverage in which datapoints will be overlaid on to live play, enabling fans to see a player’s name, their running speed, the distance of a pass and even the passing options as part of the extra information. The service will be unveiled in the UK on Tuesday night for the Tottenham v Villarreal league-phase game and will run alongside traditional coverage. Alex Green, the managing director of Prime Video Sport international, said the offering would “raise the bar for football fans and offer something meaningfully different” and that there would be further innovation “in the years to come”. Viewers in Germany and Italy will be able to access it from the Champions League’s third matchday. Amazon’s new approach has been imported from the US, where Prime Vision has operated successfully on NFL coverage for three years. For the viewer it essentially recreates the experience of watching an analyst explain a match using a telecaster, but in real-time. Further data points captured by Prime Vision include shot speed, jump height and the position of all 22 players on the pitch (displayed in a graphic at the bottom of the screen). The xG of each goalscoring opportunity will also be captured and displayed, putting a metric new to the game a decade ago at the heart of coverage. Amazon has built its own xG model and designed an algorithm that will calculate “momentum” in a match, another live stat. Andrew Hornett, Prime Video’s director of live sports production for Europe, said the innovation was optional for viewers but showed that Amazon was trying to “innovate with a purpose”. He also acknowledged the influence of games such as EA Sports’s FC in developing a more data-led way to watch. “Gaming has had an influence and [Prime Vision] has been developed by gamers,” he said. “But we haven’t defined a target audience, we’ve done it because we think it’s a cool thing to do.” Prime Vision has been a success in the US, where it won an Emmy for outstanding interactive experience in 2023. In the following year audiences for Amazon’s NFL coverage grew by 11%. Internal figures also show that the audience for Amazon’s NFL coverage was on average nearly seven years younger than that watching a linear broadcast on TV, and that on Prime Vision the audience was almost equally split between NFL obsessives and those who knew little about the sport. Amazon is a fringe player in UK sports broadcasting but its roster is growing and the tech company is able to reach sizeable audiences with its coverage; last season four of its Champions League matches reached audiences of more than 5 million people. Hornett said Amazon’s technological expertise allowed it to innovate at pace and that “it will take our rivals a bit of time to get where we are” in relation to Prime Vision. Green said the new developments showed Amazon was “here to stay” in sports. “Rights holders love our approach to their sport, the care we show and the real deep analysis we carry out,” he said. “It’s not just innovations, it’s streaming quality, it’s the low latency [delay]. I think what we can say is that we have truly established ourselves as one of the leading sports broadcasters across the world.” • This article was amended on 16 September 2025 because an earlier version referred to figures for NFL coverage showing that the Prime Vision audience was on average nearly seven years younger than that watching a linear broadcast; this relates to all viewers of their NFL coverage, not just those on Prime Vision.", "section": "Football", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

The biggest owner of datacentres in the world, Amazon dwarfs competitors Microsoft and Google and is planning a huge increase in capacity as part of a push into artificial intelligence. The Seattle firm operates hundreds of active facilities, with many more in development despite concerns over how much water is being used to cool their vast arrays of circuitry. Amazon defends its approach and has taken steps to manage how efficient its water use is, but it has faced criticism over transparency. Microsoft and Google regularly publish figures for their water consumption, but Amazon has never publicly disclosed how much water its server farms consume. When designing a campaign for water efficiency, the company’s cloud computing division chose to account for only a smaller water usage figure that does not include all the ways its datacentres use water so as to minimise the risk to its reputation, according to a leaked memo seen by SourceMaterial and the Guardian. Amazon as a whole consumed 105bn gallons (397bn litres) of water in total in 2021, as much as 958,000 US households, which would make for a city bigger than San Francisco, according to the memo. Asked about the leaked document, an Amazon spokesperson, Margaret Callahan, described it as “obsolete” and said it “completely misrepresents Amazon’s current water usage strategy”. “A document’s existence doesn’t guarantee its accuracy or finality,” she said. “Meetings often reshape documents or reveal flawed findings or claims.” Callahan would not elaborate on which strategic elements of the document were “obsolete”. The memo was dated one month before Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing division, debuted a new sustainability campaign in November 2022 called “Water Positive”, with a commitment to “return more water than it uses” by 2030. In the memo, ahead of the campaign’s launch, executives grappled with whether to include public disclosures about “secondary” use – water used in generating the electricity to power its datacentres. They warned that full transparency was “a one-way door” and advised keeping AWS’s projections confidential, even as they feared that their advice could invite accusations of a cover-up. “Amazon hides its water consumption” was one negative headline the authors anticipated. Callaghan said efficiency savings had already been achieved and pointed out that other companies also don’t count secondary water use. Executives opted to use only the relatively smaller figure of primary use, 7.7bn gallons per year, roughly equivalent to 11,600 Olympic swimming pools, when calculating progress towards internal targets because of “reputational risk”, fearing bad publicity if the full scale of Amazon’s consumption was revealed, the document shows. Ultimately as part of the campaign for water efficiency, Amazon aimed to cut its estimated 7.7bn gallon primary consumption to 4.9bn by 2030 – without addressing secondary use. Using the higher of two water usage estimates, the one that would include secondary use, “would double the size and budget” of the campaign “without addressing meaningful operational, regulatory or reputational risks”, they warned, adding that there was “no focus from customers or media” on water used for electricity. “We may decide to release water volumes in the future,” the document said. “But … we should only do so if the lack of data undermines the programme or is required by regulators.” Scientists balked at the selective disclosure and the choice not to include secondary use of water in the total. “In environmental science, it is standard practice to include both to more accurately capture the true water cost of datacentres,” said Shaolei Ren, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside. Amazon’s Water Positive campaign is still active and does not take into account secondary use, while the company continues to keep its current overall water consumption confidential. As US tech companies ride the wave of AI investment and pursue greater heights of computational power, the $2.4tn corporation is building new datacentres in some of the world’s driest areas, SourceMaterial and the Guardian revealed in April. Feeling water positive In November 2022, AWS debuted its new Water Positive sustainability campaign, with a commitment to “return more water than it uses by 2030”. The campaign only applies to AWS. The wider Amazon group, including the world’s biggest online retail business, has an overall water consumption that is far higher, 105bn gallons per year. “The models referenced in this document were preliminary and unvetted,” said Amazon’s Callahan, who declined to provide any alternative figures. The document’s authors advised the company not to release data about the wider company, but they also warned that selective disclosure could lead to accusations of a cover-up. There was “reputational risk of publicly committing to a goal for only a portion of Amazon’s direct water footprint”, they wrote. They even suggested negative headlines that might result including “Amazon disappoints, failing to take full responsibility for water”. “It would be better if they could own up to it,” said a current Amazon software developer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “Even if they said it was a low priority, at least that would be honest.” In a sustainability report in August, AWS claimed it had achieved 53% of its Water Positive goal. The division’s plan for reaching the target relies mostly on “water replenishment” projects, some in partnership with Water.org, a non-profit organisation co-founded by the actor Matt Damon. The strategy document refers to these projects as “offsets”, describing initiatives like using Amazon computer technology to help utilities prioritise which pipes to fix in order to minimise leaks. But of the $109m AWS planned to spend on offsets, about half would have been spent anyway, either to meet regulatory requirements or because the projects would help AWS operations by making water more available, the document shows. Experts said this amounted to incomplete accounting. “Regardless of what sort of offsetting or replenishment you do, it doesn’t necessarily nullify the water footprints of your own operations,” said Tyler Farrow, standards manager at the Alliance for Water Stewardship. “Calling your operations water positive or water neutral is misleading.” Amazon’s Callahan said that the “replenishment spending”, which other tech companies also undertake, is a voluntary, not a regulatory, requirement. “We’ve expanded well beyond what was imagined in the document because it’s the right thing to do for the world and for the communities in which we operate,” she said. ‘Obfuscate the water footprint’ Amazon is also engineering industry standards to downplay its water use and avert scrutiny, said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at the company. The corporation has funded efforts by the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources Institute non-profits, alongside LimnoTech, a consultancy, “to create a globally accepted methodology for quantifying the benefit of watershed restoration projects”. Responding to questions from SourceMaterial, all three organisations defended their integrity and independence, insisting that Amazon had no undue influence on any methodologies they had created. “They spend a lot of time creating methodologies that are used to obfuscate the water footprint,” Wangusi said, referring to Amazon. Callahan said Wangusi’s claim was “contradicted by facts”. “Amazon’s water use reporting is based on third-party assured data from actual utility bills, not estimates or self-reporting,” she said. Wangusi’s claim, though, was not about Amazon’s water-use reporting, but about measuring the effects of water offsets. Callahan said these efforts were “standard practice” and that Amazon’s “customers expect us to hold ourselves accountable to credible guidance and best practices”. As well as choosing not to disclose water use from electricity generation, Amazon has estimated its larger “indirect” water footprint, the document shows. This extra usage, which falls under a classification known as “scope 3”, includes water for production and construction – in Amazon’s case, mostly irrigation of cotton plantations supplying its fashion brands, and vegetables for its grocery arm, Amazon Fresh. Here, too, Amazon decided to keep its consumption confidential, even though “indirect water use represents roughly 90% of Amazon’s total water footprint”, according to the document. AWS avoided establishing targets for indirect water use because that figure would be “much more significant for the rest of Amazon, especially in the agricultural supply chain, and the team does not want to establish a standard for addressing scope 3 water use that the rest of Amazon would need to follow, given the larger resource implications”, the authors wrote. “You don’t need to obscure or obfuscate,” said Wangusi, who believes he was “hounded out” of Amazon for criticising the company’s approach. (Amazon declined to comment on his departure.) “It doesn’t make you more profitable,” he said. “It makes you less trustworthy.”", "section": "Technology", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

It is worth remembering that the word “ayahuasca” itself is not a modern invention, but a Quechua term meaning “vine of the soul”. It is just one of many names used for the ceremonial medicine across different Indigenous cultures – others include yagé, kamarampi, caapi, oasca and daime. Suggesting that only “hayakwaska” is “correct” erases the diversity of ancestral traditions across the Amazon basin. The claim that ayahuasca is marketed as a “mystical shortcut” overlooks the reality: real work with this medicine is neither quick nor easy. True healing through ayahuasca involves deep inner effort, often accompanied by discomfort, surrender and courage – whether one is Indigenous or not. The criticism of cultural distortion and biodiversity loss is valid, especially that tourism encourages the illegal wildlife trade. But we must also acknowledge that many of the products sold to tourists (such as jaguar parts) are offered by local individuals. Given their cultural knowledge and connection to the forest, Indigenous communities can and should take leadership in educating both locals and visitors, promoting sustainable and ethical practices. To ask, “How are ‘ayahuasca tourists’ giving back?” is fair. Yet tourism – when done responsibly – can be a vital source of income for rural areas, offering alternatives to logging, mining and drug trafficking. It provides jobs and preserves cultural relevance for younger generations. Enrico Malatesta Wanay Community Retreat Center, Mocoa, Colombia • I agree wholeheartedly with Nina Gualinga and Eli Virkina that ayahuasca tourism takes the shaman away from their sacred work, which is the community and the land. I know that as a UK-based shamanic healer, my work is with this land. This is what brings harmony to the soul. The plants and trees of any country are the wisdom keepers and healing cannot happen anywhere unless the land is being tended and healed. This involves releasing the souls of war and empire-building, reinstating the guardians of the sacred sites and bringing ourselves back to reciprocity. Knowing our roots and tending them brings us back into relationship with ourselves. This land and our hearts need our ancestral tending right now. For our healing to involve going to Ecuador for spiritual tourism, when there is so much ancestral and earth tending to do on our soil, shows how disconnected we still are from land and mother. We cannot find that anywhere else. The plants of these sacred isles hold so much love and wisdom now in our return to the land as a mother, as a sentient loving source who holds us. The sacred plants of these isles are dandelions, thistles, dock and nettle – they support us and guide us. Our trees are oak, birch and rowan, hawthorn. It is our communication and relationship with the earth mother and the plant spirits. A sovereign connection between ourselves and our earth. Emily Webster Lancaster • It’s always fascinating to learn about such distant remote Indigenous communities, and yet find so much in common, such as their innate respect for nature. The onset of modern tourism – often appended with “eco”, “sustainable” and “responsible” by those exploiting Indigenous people – is a common phenomenon. However, is there a lesser of two evils? “Ayahuasca” in Ecuador, as described in your piece, or the wholesale taking-over of Indigenous lands, livelihoods and cultures that we see in Cambodia? The forced assimilation in to the mainstream population was most violently imposed during the notorious 1970s Khmer Rouge regime but goes on insidiously ever since.

Would you like to have it removed?” With less than three months until tens of thousands of climate negotiators, campaigners and diplomats flock to this sweltering riverside metropolis to discuss the future of the planet, Belém’s love motels are racing to remodel themselves to receive visitors from around the globe. Ricardo Teixeira, the owner of Love Lomas, said a “de-eroticization” campaign was in full swing as motels – traditionally used for passionate rendezvous between lovers – stepped into the breach to help authorities cope with the huge influx of outsiders for November’s Cop30 summit. Mirrored ceilings, pole dancing poles and sex chairs resembling a cross between a torture rack and a weight bench were being covered or removed. Mattresses were being changed and kitsch erotic artwork being stored away to ensure bashful conference-goers felt at home. “There’s a certain stigma [attached to motels] … because they charge by the hour … but the only difference is that they’re mostly used for romantic liaisons,” said Teixeira, urging delegates to make a booking at his 48-room drive-in, just around the corner from Cop’s main venue and directly opposite the environment secretariat. Teixeira insisted love-makers were not the only ones who frequented his motel, where bedside menus offer condoms and caipirinhas and there is a £1 surcharge for dirty sheets. During Covid, frontline health workers rented rooms to avoid infecting their families. Business travellers from the interior of Pará, a state the size of South Africa of which Belém is capital, sometimes used its air-conditioned chambers. “People still have the wrong idea about motels … that outdated image from TV and films that they are brothels,” complained Teixeira, who said visiting delegates were welcome to keep the erotic chairs, if they wished. “You never know, do you?” The love motel community’s efforts to support the climate summit comes at a delicate moment for Brazil’s government which is facing a backlash over the failure to sufficiently improve Belém’s hotel infrastructure since President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced the city would host Cop30 two years ago. The lack of accommodation has caused a jaw-dropping surge in prices, with rooms hard to come by, even now. One report showed a budget hotel had hiked its rates from about £10 per night in 2023 to nearly £800 during the gathering, which is set to take place between 10 and 21 November. Earlier this month Austria said its president and negotiators would not attend the Amazon’s first-ever Cop summit citing “particularly high costs”. Some diplomats have even suggested partially relocating the event although Brazilian officials insist there is no “plan B”. In an open letter, the Climate Observatory watchdog warned the summit risked being “the most exclusionary in history” with civil society, representatives of developing nations and the press priced out. “A poorly attended Cop would be, as well as a historic humiliation for Brazil, a precious opportunity missed at a moment when we have just five years to keep the [Paris] climate agreement’s temperature target alive,” it said. So far, just 30% of the nearly 200 countries that are part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have reportedly managed to confirm bookings in Belém. Márcio Astrini, the Observatory’s director, voiced frustration that the lack of accommodation had supplanted the climate breakdown as the main topic of debate. “Fossil fuels is the key discussion we should have on the agenda right now … How is the world going to organize so there is a plan to transition away from fossil fuels? “[But] to have a negotiation about transitioning … you need to have a room full of negotiators … If the negotiators are saying they won’t come, how are you going to negotiate these topics? It simply won’t happen,” Astrini said. Addressing complaints over the lack of lodging earlier this year, Lula declared: “If there isn’t a five star hotel [available], sleep in a four-star one. If there isn’t a four-star one, sleep in a three-star one. If there isn’t a three-star one, sleep looking up at the stars … and it will be wonderful.” Authorities plan to deploy two cruise ships to serve as floating hotels for about 6,000 visitors. Belém’s sex moteliers have another solution in mind for policy wonks, ambassadors and reporters struggling to find affordable beds. “They are welcome here,” enthused Teixeira, who is the regional representative of the Brazilian Motel Association. Teixeira said motel bosses had so far offered to make nearly 600 of their estimated 2,050 rooms available for the summit. Cristiano Ribeiro, the 51-year-old owner of a motel called Só Prazer (Pleasure Only), has rented eight of its 33 rooms to Cop-goers through a government website. Guests will pay $200 a night, or $280 for rooms with jacuzzis. Ribeiro’s father, a truck driver who migrated to Belém in the 70s, founded Pleasure Only in 1995 – the year Cop’s first meeting was held in Berlin. Initially called Ponto G (G-spot), the motel changed its name to Pleasure Only after a copyright complaint from a rival. As he showed off his açaí palm-flanked premises, Ribeiro celebrated how Cop was transforming his culturally rich but economically disadvantaged home town. “It’s wonderful. We’ve progressed 30 years in one,” he said of the hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure investments that have turned much of the city into a construction site. Ribeiro has paid a graffiti artist to cover his roadside motel with murals celebrating the Amazon’s wildlife and Indigenous peoples, hoping foreign visitors would enjoy their stay. By the time they arrived, the adult channels on its televisions would have been deactivated; the sex shop selling nurses’ costumes removed; and the laminated catalogues offering furry handcuffs and “Real Peter” dildos replaced by English-language menus offering food. Pole dancing poles could be used as coat hangers. Climate negotiators would receive a warm reception. “We’ve all kinds of clients,” Ribeiro said as a pair of lovers swept into Pleasure Only on motorbike for a lunchtime romp. “We welcome them all.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

The affected platforms included Snapchat, Roblox, Signal and Duolingo as well as a host of Amazon-owned operations including its main retail site and the Ring doorbell company. More than 2,000 companies worldwide have been affected, according to Downdetector, a site that monitors internet outages, with 8.1m reports of problems from users including 1.9m reports in the US, 1m in the UK and 418,000 in Australia. Many of the sites were restored after a few hours, but some experienced persistent problems throughout the day. By Monday evening, Amazon said all of its cloud services had “returned to normal operations”. In the UK, Lloyds bank was affected, as well as its subsidiaries Halifax and Bank of Scotland, while there were also problems accessing the HM Revenue and Customs website on Monday morning. Also in the UK, Ring users complained on social media that their doorbells were not working. In the UK alone, reports of problems on individual apps ran into the tens of thousands for each platform. Other affected platforms around the world included Wordle, Coinbase, Duolingo, Slack, Pokémon Go, Epic Games, PlayStation Network and Peloton. By 10.30am UK time, Amazon was reporting that the problem, which first emerged at about 8am, was being resolved as AWS was “seeing significant signs of recovery”. However, after reporting further positive progress by late morning in the UK, Amazon still appeared to be struggling to overcome the glitch this afternoon as it acknowledged it was still experiencing elevated errors. “We can confirm significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services … We are investigating,” AWS said in an update at about 7am Pacific time and 3pm UK time. To aid the recovery, AWS said it was putting in place limits on the number of requests that could be made on its platform. Experts said the outage underlined the dangers of the internet’s reliance on a small number of tech companies, with Amazon, Microsoft and Google playing a key role in the cloud market. Dr Corinne Cath-Speth, the head of digital at human rights organisation Article 19, said: “We urgently need diversification in cloud computing. The infrastructure underpinning democratic discourse, independent journalism and secure communications cannot be dependent on a handful of companies.” Cori Crider, the executive director of the Future of Technology Institute, a thinktank that supports a sovereign technology framework for Europe, said: “The UK can’t keep leaving its critical infrastructure at the mercy of US tech giants. With Amazon Web Services down, we’ve seen the lights go out across the modern economy – from banking to communications.” Madeline Carr, professor of global politics and cybersecurity at University College London, said it was “hard to disagree” with warnings about the over-reliance of the global internet on a small number of companies. “The counter-argument is that it’s these large hyper-scaling companies that have the financial resources to provide a secure, global and resilient service. But most people outside those companies would argue that is a risky position for the world to be in.” Last year, airports, healthcare services and businesses worldwide were hit by the “largest outage in history”, caused by a botched software upgrade from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike that hit Microsoft’s Windows operating system. Amazon reported that the problem on Monday originated in the east coast of the US at Amazon Web Services, a unit that provides vital web infrastructure for a host of companies, which rent out space on Amazon servers. AWS is the world’s largest cloud computing platform. Shortly after midnight (PDT) in the US (8am BST) on Monday, Amazon confirmed “increased error rates and latencies” for AWS services in a region on the east coast of the US. The ripple effect hit services around the world, with Downdetector reporting problems with the same sites in multiple continents. Cisco’s Thousand Eyes, a service that tracks internet outages, also reported a surge in problems on Monday morning, with many of them located in Virginia, the location of Amazon’s US-East-1 region, where AWS said the problems began and where AWS has a number of datacentres. Experts said the outage appeared to be an IT issue rather than a cyber-attack. AWS’s online health dashboard referred to DynamoDB, its database system where AWS customers store their data. Amazon appeared to rule out foul play, saying the root cause was an internal subsystem responsible for monitoring its load balancers, which prevent traffic from overloading its servers. “The incident appears to have been caused by some accident within AWS, rather than being the result of any malicious intent,” said Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London. The UK government has said it is in contact with Amazon over the outage. A spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.” The House of Commons’ treasury committee in the UK has written to the economic secretary to the Treasury, Lucy Rigby, to ask why the government had not yet designated Amazon a “critical third party” to the UK’s financial services sector – which would expose the tech firm to financial regulatory oversight. The committee chair, Meg Hillier, pointed out that Amazon had recently told the committee that financial services customers were using AWS to support their “resilience” and that AWS offered “multiple layers of protection”.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

Don’t expect Amazon to replace it", "date": null, "author": "Niamh Rowe", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "In towns where Washington DC is an abstraction, the post office is the front desk of American democracy – sometimes the only public space at all. Here, postmasters are “the human side of government”, as the senator Jennings Randolph put it in 1976. “When such offices are closed,” he warned, “the American flag really comes down.” Championed by Benjamin Franklin in 1775, the roots of the US postal service – whose mandate is to “bind the nation together” – are older than the republic itself. The constitution calls for “post offices and post roads”. The USPS is still legally obligated to provide a “basic and fundamental” service to all Americans. In Scottsbluff, Nebraska, a rural carrier drives more than 700 miles a year to serve just two households. But after years in the red – and amid open hostility from the Trump administration – its future looks uncertain. The USPS has lost about $114bn since 2007, according to financial reports, amid declining letter volume, competition from private carriers and rising employee costs. Meanwhile, the specter of privatization looms larger than ever. “The postal service is a joke,” Donald Trump told reporters in 2020. A reform plan during his previous administration called for restructuring it “to return it to a sustainable business model or prepare it for future conversion from a Government agency into a privately-held corporation”. Given this historical scorn, it was no surprise when reports broke in February that Trump was considering dissolving the agency’s leadership and absorbing it into the Department of Commerce. “The fate of the USPS is no longer financial or managerial, but political,” James O’Rourke, a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, recently told me. “Putting the post office up for an IPO would not be much of a stretch in the current climate. The checks and balances are gone.” Indeed, a Wells Fargo memo to investors titled “USPS Privatization: A Framework” was leaked last month. It reads: “Parcel could be carved out and sold or IPOed.” The plan predicts parcel prices would increase 30%–140% across product lines and proposes a post office sell-off so that “value can be harvested” from the real estate. Yet if the parcel segment were “carved out”, not all of the carcass would bear meat. Investors will seize only the parts they can further monetize, O’Rourke says. That would mean closing small-town post offices and ending home delivery on unprofitable routes. Think of the mule train that descends into Havasupai territory in the Grand Canyon; the small aircraft and seasonal boats that serve Little Diomede, Alaska, where residents can see Russia from their windows; or Point Roberts, Washington, where mail crosses Canada to reach a US town. If universal service falters, those addresses are likely to be abandoned first. People in affected zip codes – already more likely to be lower income – will have to travel to pick up parcels or pay steep delivery costs. “Those people will do with less or do without,” O’Rourke says. But the cost of losing universal service would be more than financial. Vote-by-mail and absentee ballots are particularly critical in rural areas with distant polling stations, and the USPS ensures those ballots reach voters. It also handles 1.2bn prescription-drug shipments each year, as of 2020, according to the National Association of Letter Carriers union. In places with no nearby banks, the post office may be the only location where residents can pay bills. Rural postal workers also fulfill a civic role that transcends transporting mail. A study of village postmasters from the 1970s illustrates how closely woven they can become into civic life: “People going out of town commonly leave their house keys with the postmaster … residents leave notes with the postmaster for friends to retrieve later in the day.” While the advent of the internet renders that depiction somewhat antiquated, its essence remains true. “Rural carriers are still the fabric that knits some communities together,” Don Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, told me. In some towns, carriers may be the only contact residents have with the outside world – and thus a lifeline, he added. Carriers still carry out “wellness checks” if a resident fails to collect their mail. Mark Jamison spent 15 years as a postmaster in a remote office in the mountains of North Carolina, where he was the town’s only government worker. Many residents were not literate, so he assisted with written tasks. Older residents would stop by the post office on their way home so he could open their jars. He assembled bicycles at Christmas. Locals referred to him as the “bartender”, because people came in with stories to tell and advice to seek. “There are still postal employees who do that,” Jamison said. While the USPS has staved off a formal sell-off so far under the current administration, its universal service is already being eroded in de facto terms. This year, its 10-year “Delivering for America” modernization plan kicks off in a bid to save at least $36 billion. The plan will slow service for about three-quarters of the country’s zip codes, according to the advocacy group Save the Post Office, with rural areas bearing the brunt. The Postal Regulatory Commission voiced opposition to the plan in January, noting it was “very concerned” about how it would disadvantage rural communities. Louis DeJoy, the former US postmaster general, announced a plan in March to cut 10,000 USPS jobs. Amid reports Trump urged the USPS board of governors to appoint FedEx board member David P Steiner as postmaster general, Brian Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, alleged a “hostile takeover” of the postal service. (Steiner, who took the job in July, has said he does not believe the USPS should be privatized and that he believes “in the current structure of the postal service as a self-financing, independent entity of the executive branch”.) At the same time, Amazon Logistics is on track to surpass the USPS as the nation’s largest parcel carrier by volume. The company is also speeding up in rural America, as AI-driven efficiencies make more routes economically viable. In April, it announced a $4bn investment to expand its rural “last-mile” network – tripling its size by the end of next year and reaching 13,000 more rural zip codes. This will be welcome news to those households. But Amazon drivers can’t go the extra mile. They lack the civic responsibilities of government workers, and their routes fluctuate algorithmically, meaning it’s harder to build community ties. What’s more, Amazon’s last-mile network will expand only as long as it’s profitable to do so. “I don’t see it going into the mule train business, right?” said Christopher W Shaw, author of First Class: The US Postal Service, Democracy, and the Corporate Threat. An Amazon driver will never sing the USPS’s unofficial motto: “Every piece, every address, every day.” Without a legal mandate, why would they?

But in an unlikely convergence of views, both the centre-right state governor and leftwing social movements insist this is a storm in a plant pot compared with the darkening geopolitical threats to the world’s biggest diplomatic gathering, which will take place in November in Belém. This tropical port, which sits on the mouth of the Amazon River, is one of the poorest cities in Brazil. It faces mounting criticism about its preparations for an international conference that is on a far greater scale than anything previously seen in the rainforest region. A shortage of beds has driven hotel prices so high that the federal government has threatened to prosecute price-gougers. Traffic congestion, already bad, is expected to become horrific with the expected influx of 50,000 visitors during the event. Conservation groups have been shocked by the clearance of forests for new highways and there is scepticism that the city’s infrastructure projects, including a doubling of the airport’s capacity, will be ready in time. But in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the Pará state governor, Helder Barbalho – who says he asked President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in November 2022 to nominate Belém as host – said everything was on track. “All the projects that were planned and structured will be ready so that we can hold a fantastic event in November,” he said. He insisted the event will be worthwhile to improve the lives of city residents and for civil society to finally be given a voice after three consecutive Cops in autocratic nations. Barbalho said: “We understand that it will be the Cop with the greatest popular participation in history and that is something we have particularly encouraged.” Belém is already a hive of construction activity, though critics claim the benefits are mainly for real estate developers and major corporations, while there is little effort to reduce economic inequality in the urban peripheries or integrate nature into urban planning Mask-wearing welders are illuminated by blue sparks at the Parque da Cidade, a former airport that will stage the main conference centre. Signs say the work here is being carried out by Brazil’s biggest mining company, Vale, which has been responsible for some of the country’s deadliest and most environmentally destructive disasters, including the 2019 collapse of the Brumadinho tailings dam, which killed 272 people. Close to the colonial-era Cidade Velha – or old town – district, a new urban park is under construction between a complex of middle-class high rises and a swanky redevelopment of old warehouses that are now upmarket restaurants selling an extraordinary range of fish dishes and ice-creams made from regional fruits. The most striking feature of the new concrete space are several dozen “eco-trees” made from recycled steel bars that branch out into canopy-like supports for pots full of hanging plants. This proved controversial when a city official admitted the designs were copied from Singapore for shade because Belém is warming rapidly and there was not enough good soil in this area to plant real trees. It confirmed what people could see and feel. Belém was once known as the city of mango trees, but has experienced a dramatic loss of urban vegetation over the past 20 years. This process has been compounded by the Cop30-accelerated expansion of two new roads – Avenida Liberdade and Rua da Marinha – that together resulted in the clearance of more than 100 hectares (247 acres) of vegetation. Ana Claudia Cardoso, a professor of urbanism at the Federal University of Pará, predicted Belém would have less tree cover in the city after Cop than it did before. Barbalho said the road improvements had been planned two years before the Cop bid and were built to high environmental standards with walls on either side to prevent roadkill and high numbers of dedicated animal crossings. He said it would reduce traffic jams and their associated carbon emissions. He preferred to focus on the bigger picture: that Pará – long a centre of Amazon destruction – is now at the forefront of efforts to reduce deforestation, which halved between 2018 and 2024. “We had the courage to build a new history,” he said, also stressing efforts to reforest faster than any other state in Brazil, secure the majority of carbon credits, initiate a cattle-tracing programme and build a “bioeconomy” by investing in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals to replace cattle ranching. Such talk – and his willingness to work with Lula, the Workers’ party president – makes Barbalho an exception among the governors of Amazonian states, almost all of whom are far-right Bolsonarists. But he shares similar extractivist roots, owning more than 6,000 cattle and shares in a ranch among his listed assets of 18.75m real (£2.48m) in 2022. The scion of the most powerful dynasty in the state (his father is a senator, media tycoon and landowner) is known as “the king of the north” and widely believed to be building his global reputation for a future bid for the presidency. Many on the left distrust Barbalho and say he overstates his achievements, which are more to do with federal policies. But there is grudging respect for his intelligence, ability to secure such a prestigious global meeting, and promise to support civil society. There is also a shared frustration at external criticism of “chaotic” Belém. Many see this as hypocrisy from the global north, which is now much more of a threat to multilateralism because conflict is worsening, rich countries have failed to provide sufficient climate finance, and Donald Trump has begun pulling the US out of the Paris agreement. Caetano Scannavino, the coordinator of the Health and Happiness Project in the Amazon, said: “More than just logistics, these are gigantic challenges for Brazil in exercising the mandate that the world gave us to lead the negotiations until November 2025. We are about to lose the battle of the 1.5C goal [of limiting global heating above preindustrial levels] of Paris, and the only consensus among the nations that claim to be leaders of humanity – the US, China, Russia and Europe – is to put more money into buying weapons.” Amid the collapsing consensus, the Brazilian chair of Cop30, ambassador André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, has proposed an agenda for governments that steers clear of contentious issues. Instead, he has called on civil society to take the lead in applying pressure. Indigenous communities have been promised a more prominent role both in the official conference venue and at a parallel four-day “people’s summit” in the university grounds that is expected to draw about 15,000 participants from traditional communities, NGOs and academia. Several demonstrations are planned, the biggest of which will be a march during the middle weekend of the conference. But there is a risk in raising expectations for protests and public meetings. Without clear mechanisms and authority for civil society to influence the official debate, protesters may feel frustrated that they are involved in little more than grandstanding. Given the Brazilian police’s widespread support for Bolsonaro and tendency to resort to teargas and violence at public gatherings, there are concerns that street conflicts could further undermine prospects for a global consensus. Barbalho said the organisers would be well prepared to avoid problems. Security is being coordinated by the federal government, who have organised a national committee with representatives from the armed forces and police. Seven hundred members of Pará’s military police are receiving special training. Some veteran activists are wary but determined. Eunice Guedes of the Brazilian Women’s Articulation said: “We are concerned that the city will be militarised and that the exclusion zone will be large. We have been talking to the city hall of Belém to define its size. Security is a concern.” But most talk of their hopes for a festive spirit, a long-term shift in local policies and a chance to show a different – and urban – side of the rainforest. Mariana Guimarães, a Belém-based environmentalist and international political adviser to the Cop30 civil society committee, said she was looking forward to challenging preconceptions – for better or for worse. She said: “I think it’s an opportunity not just for the world to know the Amazon, but also for Brazil to know the Amazon, because we understand that there are a lot of these stereotypes of what the region is, right? “Many people will come here thinking they will enter a dense forest and all that, and they will see that there will be no real trees here in Belém. Visitors will get to know another Amazon, get to know our culture, definitely enjoy the food that we have, the music and everything else.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

Hosting the tens of thousands of delegates who make the trip is a big undertaking for any city. But the decision to host Cop30 in Belém, at the mouth of the Amazon river, has multiplied the complications. After three consecutive Cops in autocratic nations, the stated aim of Cop30’s chair, André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, is to make this year’s event a showcase for civil society, including the Indigenous groups and forest defenders who play such a vital role in conservation. But the lack of affordable accommodation and other infrastructure, as well as the distance that must be travelled to reach the Amazon port, mean this commendable ideal will be hard to realise. Dom Phillips’ posthumously published book, How To Save the Amazon: A Journalist’s Deadly Quest for Answers, is a compelling reminder of what is at stake. It is nearly three years since he was killed along with Bruno Pereira, a Brazilian government employee whose job was monitoring isolated Indigenous groups. The pair were on the way back from a trip to the remote Javari valley. The search and investigation were initially botched. Two men will go on trial for murder later this year. Phillips and Pereira understood the risks they ran, in struggling to document the destruction that was then taking place. Between 2019 and 2023, under the far-right presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, progress on rainforest conservation went into sharp reverse and deforested areas grew rapidly. Illegal loggers, miners and ranchers effectively had carte blanche, as the agencies tasked with upholding environmental regulations were weakened and disbanded. Over the same period, and encouraged by the government’s laissez-faire approach, competition between drug traffickers over lucrative smuggling routes intensified. Owing to its remoteness, the Javari reserve, near the border with Peru, became a key battleground. Under President Lula the situation has stabilised. His environment minister, Marina Silva, is the right person to oversee the government’s policy of zero net deforestation by 2030. But plans to expand the country’s fossil fuel production are impossible to square with these environmental goals. The risk that global heating and deforestation could cause a mass dieback of the rainforest, triggering the release of vast stores of carbon, continues to trouble scientists. At the same time, doubts are growing about whether this year’s deadline for certification of the beef supply chain as deforestation-free will be met. Under strong international pressure, JBS, the world’s largest meat company, is putting new systems in place. But the huge number of farmers (Brazil has a cattle herd of 240m), the terrain, gaps in land registration, and systems set up to bypass checks, mean the prospects for success are not high. Having the global spotlight on the forest should at least focus minds. The Amazon’s biodiversity, and role in climate regulation, make it too important to lose. Indigenous defenders, some of whom worked with Pereira and Phillips, continue the vital work of championing the landscape that is their home. The journalist’s book, completed by his friends, shows the urgency of supporting their courageous efforts. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Graphics by Paul Scruton and Lucy Swan", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "The world’s largest meat company, JBS, looks set to break its Amazon rainforest protection promises again, according to frontline workers. Beef production is the primary driver of deforestation, as trees are cleared to raise cattle, and scientists warn this is pushing the Amazon close to a tipping point that would accelerate its shift from a carbon sink into a carbon emitter. JBS, the Brazil-headquartered multinational that dominates the Brazilian cattle market, promised to address this with a commitment to clean up its beef supply chain in the region by the end of 2025. In a project to understand the barriers to progress on Amazon deforestation, a team of journalists from the Guardian, Unearthed and Repórter Brasil interviewed more than 35 people, including ranchers and ranching union leaders who represent thousands of farms in the states of Pará and Rondônia. The investigation found widespread disbelief that JBS would be able to complete the groundwork and hit its deforestation targets. “They certainly have the will to do it, just as we have the will to do it,” said one rancher. But the goal that all the cattle they bought would be deforestation-free was unreachable, he said. “They say this is going to be implemented. I’d say straight away: that’s impossible.” The problem of illegal cattle laundering would also not be resolved in time, said many, while another interviewee said land ownership issues meant quite simply that the deadline was “impossible”. JBS told the Guardian that it contested the conclusions. “Drawing inferences and conclusions from a limited sample of 30 farmers while disregarding that JBS has over 40,000 registered suppliers is entirely irresponsible,” the company said in a statement. It said that “while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks.” To hit its targets, JBS needs to register all its direct and indirect suppliers and ensure none of the meat it buys from the Amazon is from cattle that has grazed on deforested land. It has established a network of “green offices” to provide free consultation to ranchers on how to comply with the three- to six-month process of regularisation, which involves drawing up a plan to plant more trees, withdrawing from contested territory, or making other environmental remediations. Then details will go into the JBS database, which continually monitors farms using artificial intelligence, and owners will be contacted if they fail to meet their obligations. In Pará, the company is also working with the state government on an ear-tagging scheme that would track the state’s entire herd of 26 million cattle by 2026. The Pará state governor, Helder Barbalho, who has supported the traceability plan, expects JBS to meet its deadline, but he acknowledged there had been resistance and that small farmers in particular would need more support. He said the Bezos Earth Fund had committed 143m reais to this task: “We are still mobilising resources so that we can finance this policy that is very important for us to present to livestock farmers.” But ranchers and rancher unions interviewed by the Guardian and its partners said that technical hurdles and uncertainties over land ownership – many ranches were created by invading public land – stood no chance of resolution by the company’s self-imposed deadline. Adelosmar Antonio Orio, known as Ticão, who works for the Tucumaã-Ourilaãndia Union of Rural Producers, said the logistical challenges, such as ranchers needing special equipment including ear trackers and satellite internet systems, would make the scheme impossible to complete before the year-end deadline. “Not even they [JBS] know how this traceability is going to be implemented,” he said. Others argued that new small- and medium-sized producers were being asked to bear most of the burden of the new system and that JBS and the government had not done enough to explain the new tracking system and provide the technological support needed to make it work. The thorny subject of land ownership would also be impossible to resolve, argued many, including Cristina Malcher, the president of the Commission of Women in Agribusiness, a national advocacy body for women in agriculture. “The deadline of 2025 is impossible to meet, because if you don’t know who owns the land, then you don’t have environmental regularity,” Malcher told the Guardian. Ticão agreed. “By the end of the year, we need to resolve all the land problems, all the environmental problems.” Could it be done in time? “Definitely not,” he said. His union colleagues expressed similar disbelief that the deadline could be met. The investigation also spoke to indirect suppliers who openly admitted to using middlemen to clean up the environmental record of their livestock, a practice known as cattle laundering. Several producers predicted that a new tracing system would lead to new loopholes, such as slaughtering the cattle elsewhere and then selling the meat – rather than live cattle – at a low price to JBS. JBS has not mapped its entire supply chain, due under its deforestation commitments by the end of this year. But the company said: “JBS has already enrolled the equivalent of over 80% of its annual cattle purchases on to a blockchain-enabled, web-based transparent farming livestock platform.” JBS has previously been linked to deforestation on a number of occasions, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit last year accusing the company of misleading consumers with its climate goals in an effort to increase sales. A bipartisan group of 15 US senators urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject JBS’s application for a share listing. “Dozens of journalistic and NGO reports have shown that JBS is linked to more destruction of forests and other ecosystems than any other company in Brazil,” they wrote in an open letter. JBS told the Guardian: “The challenges of addressing illegal deforestation on cattle operations that span millions of farms across hundreds of thousands of square kilometresare significant.” It detailed its response, which includes zero tolerance for deforestation sourcing policy, state-of-the-art supply chain monitoring, free technical assistance for producers to help regularise their farms, and the JBS Fund for the Amazon, which finances projects focused on the sustainable development of the Amazon biome. The company also said: “JBS works with farmers, ranchers and partners across the food system to develop solutions that support a growing global population while optimising resources and reducing agriculture’s environmental impact. Cattle raising in the Amazon is undergoing a sectoral transformation, and one company cannot solve all the industry’s challenges.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Amazon", "companies": ["Amazon"]}

Yet in the years since then, the company has moved in the opposite direction as it invests in energy-intensive artificial intelligence. In its latest sustainability report, Google said its carbon emissions had increased 51% between 2019 and 2024. New research aims to debunk even that enormous figure and provide context to Google’s sustainability reports, painting a bleaker picture. A report authored by non-profit advocacy group Kairos Fellowship found that, between 2019 and 2024, Google’s carbon emissions actually went up by 65%. What’s more, between 2010, the first year there is publicly available data on Google’s emissions, and 2024, Google’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 1,515%, Kairos found. The largest year-over-year jump in that window was also the most recent, 2023 to 2024, when Google saw a 26% increase in emissions just between 2023 and 2024, according to the report. “Google’s own data makes it clear: the corporation is contributing to the acceleration of climate catastrophe, and the metrics that matter – how many emissions they emit, how much water they use, and how fast these trends are accelerating – are headed in the wrong direction for us and the planet,” said Nicole Sugerman, a campaign manager at Kairos Fellowship. The authors say that they found the vast majority of the numbers they used to determine how much energy Google is using and how much its carbon emissions are increasing in the appendices of Google’s own sustainability reports. Many of those numbers were not highlighted in the main body of Google’s reports, they say. After the report published, Google called its findings into question in a statement. “The analysis by the Kairos Fellowship distorts the facts. Our carbon emissions are calculated according to the widely used Greenhouse Gas Protocol and assured by a third party. Our carbon reduction ambition has been validated by the leading industry body, the Science Based Targets initiative,” said a spokesperson, Maggie Shiels. The authors behind the report, titled Google’s Eco-Failures, attribute the discrepancy between the numbers they calculated and the numbers Google highlights in its sustainability reports to various factors, including that the firm uses a different metric for calculating how much its emissions have increased. While Google uses market-based emissions, the researchers used location-based emissions. Location-based emissions are the average emissions the company produces from its use of local power grids, while market-based emissions include energy the company has purchased to offset its total emissions. “[Location-based emissions] represents a company’s ‘real’ grid emissions,” said Franz Ressel, the lead researcher and report co-author. “Market-based emissions are a corporate-friendly metric that obscures a polluter’s actual impact on the environment. It allows companies to pollute in one place, and try to ‘offset’ those emissions by purchasing energy contracts in another place.” The energy the tech giant has needed to purchase to power its data centers alone increased 820% since 2010, according to Kairos’s research, a figure that is expected to expand in the future as Google rolls out more AI products. Between 2019 and 2024, emissions that came primarily from the purchase of electricity to power data centers jumped 121%, the report’s authors said. “In absolute terms, the increase was 6.8 TWh, or the equivalent of Google adding the entire state of Alaska’s energy use in one year to their previous use,” said Sugerman. Based on Google’s current trajectory, the Kairos report’s authors say the company is unlikely to meet its own 2030 deadline without a significant push from the public. There are three categories of greenhouse gas emissions – called Scopes 1, 2 and 3 – and Google has only meaningfully decreased its Scope 1 emissions since 2019, according to the Kairos report. Scope 1 emissions, which include emissions just from Google’s own facilities and vehicles, account for only 0.31% of the company’s total emissions, according to the report. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that come primarily from the electricity Google purchases to power its facilities, and scope 3 accounts for indirect emissions from all other sources such as suppliers, use of Google’s consumer devices or employee business travel. “It’s not sustainable to keep building at the rate [Google is] building because they need to scale their compute within planetary limits,” said Sugerman. “We do not have enough green energy to serve the needs of Google and certainly not the needs of Google and the rest of us.” Thirsty, power-hungry data centers As the company builds out resource-intensive data centers across the country, experts are also paying close attention to Google’s water usage. According to the company’s own sustainability report, Google’s water withdrawal – how much water is taken from various sources – increased 27% between 2023 and 2024 to 11bn gallons of water. The amount is “enough to supply the potable water needs for the 2.5 million people and 5,500 industrial users in Boston and its suburbs for 55 days”, according to the Kairos report. Tech companies have faced both internal and public pressure to power their growing number of data centers with clean energy. Amazon employees recently put forth a package of shareholder proposals that asked the company to disclose its overall carbon emissions and targeted the climate impact of its data centers. The proposals were ultimately voted down. On Sunday, several organizations including Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, League of Conservation Voters, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club, published an open letter in the San Francisco Chronicle and the Seattle Times calling on the CEOs of Google, Amazon and Microsoft to “commit to no new gas and zero delayed coal plant retirements to power your data centers”. “In just the last two years alone, your companies have built data centers throughout the United States capable of consuming more electricity than four million American homes,” the letter reads. “Within five years, your data centers alone will use more electricity than 22 million households, rivaling the consumption of multiple mid-size states.” In its own sustainability report, Google warns that the firm’s “future trajectories” may be affected by the “evolving landscape” of the tech industry. “We’re at an extraordinary inflection point, not just for our company specifically, but for the technology industry as a whole – driven by the rapid growth of AI,” the report reads. “The combination of AI’s potential for non-linear growth driven by its unprecedented pace of development and the uncertain scale of clean energy and infrastructure needed to meet this growth makes it harder to predict our future emissions and could impact our ability to reduce them.” The Kairos report accuses Google of relying “heavily on speculative technologies, particularly nuclear power”, to achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2030. “Google’s emphasis on nuclear energy as a clean energy ‘solution’ is particularly concerning, given the growing consensus among both scientists and business experts that their successful deployment on scale, if it is to ever occur, cannot be achieved in the near or mid-term future,” the report reads. The Kairos report alleges the way that Google presents some of its data is misleading. In the case of data center emissions, for example, Google says it has improved the energy efficiency of its data centers by 50% over 13 years. Citing energy efficiency numbers rather than sharing absolute ones obscures Google’s total emissions, the authors argue. “In fact, since 2010, the company’s total energy consumption has increased 1,282%,” the report concluded.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, told a Senate estimates hearing on Thursday that the tech company’s moderation practices had recently undermined the reach and cost-effectiveness of the national campaign, run by Sexual and Reproductive Health Australia (SRHA). Google added “STI testing” to its list of sensitive topics in November 2024, triggering an automatic rejection of each ad, causing weeks of delays, Waters said. “It’s interfering with public health objectives and potentially wasting the commonwealth money … Google’s censoring actually what is a very protective public health campaign.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Daile Kelleher, the CEO of SRHA, told Guardian Australia the organisation had paid Google for their ads to be distributed through its online channels because “we know that’s where young people are and where the education needs to be”. However, the ad was auto-rejected on 12 occasions and the organisation had to contact Google on 10 different occasions. As Google attempted to help them get around the filters, “we were told to change some of the wording around our campaign, which would have watered down the message and probably not actually met people where they were at in terms of their STI knowledge,” Kelleher said. Each time the ad was blocked, it interfered with how the ad system learned the relevant demographic of those who would want to click through to the website, where they could find evidence-based information and have the ability to book a test at a clinic, she said. During the period Google’s filters were interfering with the ads, each click-through was costing up to $17 per click. Once the filters were sorted and the relevant target audience reached, increasing traffic to the ad, the cost came down to 39c per click, Kelleher said. It is not an isolated incident as other sexual health topics including contraception have also triggered ads on the site being blocked previously, she said. “There really needs to be something broader done,” she said. The worry is that filters will block evidence-based campaigns based on legal activities, while “misinformation and disinformation that is able to spread far and wide gets in front of people far easier than our content does,” Kelleher said. Health promotion ads should never had been blocked in the first place and more needs to be done to fix the situation, she said. Waters said the issue should be the government’s concern. Malarndirri McCarthy, minister for Indigenous Australians, representing the health minister, Mark Butler, at Senate estimates said she would follow up the issue with Butler as well as the communications minister.

That makes it a contender for the top smaller phone with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro, offering the best of Google’s hardware without an enormous screen. It is also the cheapest of three Pixel 10 Pro phones starting at £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699) sitting below the bigger 10 Pro XL and the tablet-phone hybrid the 10 Pro Fold. The 10 Pro looks almost identical to last year’s version and has the same size 6.3in OLED screen as the Pixel 10 but slightly brighter, slicker and crisper. It is one of the best displays on a phone, while the polished aluminium sides and mat glass back look expensive even if the colour choice is rather staid compared with its cheaper sibling. The 10 Pro is one of the first phones to come with Qi2 wireless charging built into the back, which offers compatibility with a range of magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe. Inside is Google’s latest Tensor G5 chip, which is about 35% faster than last year’s model but falls short of the best-in-class performance of Qualcomm’s top Android chip used in rivals. Day to day the 10 Pro feels rapid, and it handled games just fine, though there are better options for those who want the absolute best graphics and frame rates. The Pixel has solid battery life, managing up to about two days between charges with about seven hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi. Most people will need to charge it every other day, but on heavy use days out and about in London on 5G it still managed to reach midnight with at least 25% left. Specifications Screen: 6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi) Processor: Google Tensor G5 RAM: 16GB Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: Android 16 Camera: 50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, nano + e-sim (US: e-sim-only), wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm Weight: 207g Android 16 with AI everywhere The phone ships with Android 16 installed, with security and software updates until August 2032, ensuring it stays up to date for the life of the phone. It is the same software as the regular Pixel 10 with a bold, colourful and fun design. Google has shoved AI in almost every corner of the phone, most of it powered by the latest local Gemini Nano models, which means your data doesn’t have to leave your device to be processed, preserving privacy. The advanced Gemini chatbot is capable of interacting with your apps, seeing what is on your screen or through your camera, and having live back-and forth-conversations via voice. But the standout new feature is Magic Cue, which runs in the background and combines information from your Google account with data on your phone to offer help or quick suggestions in a number of Google apps. For instance, when you ring a business, Magic Cue pops up a card directly in the phone app showing your emails with your order confirmation details for one-tap access when you need them. Magic Cue works locally with about 10 days’ worth of data so it is not keeping a permanent log of everything you do, but has been genuinely useful in testing. It only works in Google’s and a select number of third-party apps, such as eBay, but not WhatsApp, so its utility is limited if you don’t use the right apps. The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription to Google AI Pro, which usually costs £19 a month, and provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image and video-generating models, plus 2TB of cloud storage for Google Drive, Photos and Gmail. Camera The 10 Pro has some of the most powerful cameras on a smartphone with a 42-megapixel selfie, 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera capable of an optical zoom quality up to 10x. But it is also the first to feature generative AI image processing directly in the camera, which is impressive but calls into question what a photo really is. The main camera is one of the best in the business, effortlessly capturing great photos that are rich in detail across a range of lighting conditions. The ultrawide camera is also very good for landscapes and group shots, and is used for the great macrophotography mode for fun closeups. The 5x telephoto is one of the very best on a phone and can shoot photos at 10x, which remain good quality, particularly in bright conditions. Google excels in difficult lighting conditions such as very bright or contrasting scenes, while in dark environments its night sight produces sharper images with more accurate colours than rivals. The Pixel’s portrait mode is greatly improved this year, too. Zoom beyond 30x up to 100x and the phone uses a local genAI model to put back into the photo the detail and sharpness lost from digital zoom. Generally it works well but not flawlessly. It can get the perspective wrong or superimposes the wrong details, creating images that are clearly made by AI. But shoot predictable subjects such as buildings, cars or trees, and it firms up the digitally stretched details making the 100x zoom surprisingly usable. When it detects a person it does not even attempt to use the genAI model, which is probably for the best, and like all genAI systems it can struggle with words, often producing something that looks like an alien script. The camera app adds C2PA content credentials to all photos that records how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved, including for the new zoom and popular Add Me feature from last year. Best Take has been made automatic, allowing the camera to capture multiple images when you press the shutter button to try to get one where everyone’s looking at the camera. The 10 Pro also has the same new AI Camera Coach feature as the regular 10, which teaches you how to get a better shot by analysing the scene through the camera and giving you options for different angles and framing. The camera also has plenty of fun photography and video modes, shoots great films as well as photo, and cements the 10 Pro as one of the very best on the market. Sustainability The battery will last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repair, with manuals and parts available. The Pixel 10 Pro contains 30% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free. Price The Google Pixel 10 Pro costs from £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699) in a choice of four colours. For comparison, the Pixel 10 starts at £799, the Pixel 10 Pro XL at £1,199, the Pixel 9a costs £399, the Samsung Galaxy S25 costs £799, the Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,249 and the iPhone 16 Pro costs £999. Verdict The Pixel 10 Pro doesn’t reinvent the wheel or set a new bar in quite the same way as the base-model Pixel 10 managed this year. But it still upgrades its already market-leading camera and AI features. It is snappy in operation, has decent battery life and still looks good, though hardcore gamers may want to look elsewhere for more powerful graphics. Google’s take on Android is one of the best and comes with long-term support so you can keep using it for years. Gemini’s various new tools are generally useful and less gimmicky than many. Magic Cue has great potential to be a time-saver without getting in the way, but needs to be expanded to more apps. Injecting genAI directly into the camera app improves its extended zoom images, but further blurs the line between what is and isn’t a photo – a philosophical debate most will probably gloss over because the tool is useful and avoids doing anything outlandish. The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the best smaller phones available and really hammers home just how much more advanced Google’s AI tools are than Apple’s and other rivals. Pros: seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, solid battery life, great screen and size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included. Cons: quite expensive, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical sim card slot in the US, not a big upgrade from the standard Pixel 10.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

The regular Pixel 10 costs £799 (€899/$799/A$1,349) – the same as last year’s Pixel 9 – undercutting the 10 Pro by £200 and matching rivals from Samsung and Apple while offering more for your money. The design is almost identical to the Pixel 9, except for some new bold colours and the all-important new third camera in the pill-shaped lump on the back. The satin aluminium and glass body feels like a quality piece of hardware and the design certainly stands out in a sea of samey slab phones. The 6.3in OLED screen is crisp, super-bright and smooth with a 120Hz refresh rate. The glass back hides another upgrade: Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support. Google is making its own Pixelsnap gadgets but Qi2 is an open standard and cross-compatible with the plethora of accessories designed for Apple’s excellent MagSafe, including chargers, wallets, handles and stands that just stick to the back of the phone. Specifications Screen: 6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi) Processor: Google Tensor G5 RAM: 12GB Storage: 128 or 256GB Operating system: Android 16 Camera: 48MP+ 13MP UW + 10.8MP 5x tele; 10.5MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSim, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mm Weight: 204g Tensor G5 The new Tensor G5 chip is about 34-38% faster than Google’s previous top processor in testing, which is quite a leap for the brand, but still falls short of the raw performance of Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon chip used in rivals. The Pixel feels rapid in operation and will handle most things just fine. The battery life is solid if not class-leading. It manages roughly two days of light usage between charges or about 33 hours of heavy use, including five hours of 5G out and about with seven hours actively using the screen. Most people will need to charge it every other day. The Tensor G5 also includes a significantly faster AI processor that runs Google’s advanced AI quicker and handles more complex systems on-device, making the Pixel a showcase for Google’s AI prowess. Android 16 with AI The Pixel 10 runs the latest Android 16 out of the box and comes with software support until August 2032. Google’s take on Android is full of bold colours, big buttons and fun typography with plenty of nice touches and haptic interactions throughout the system. It’s a quality experience even if you choose more subtle colour combinations. The Pixel is a vehicle for some of Google’s most advanced AI systems, running the latest version of Gemini Nano on-device, which powers all sorts of AI features including various writing, dictation and image-editing tools. A flashy new voice translation system for phone calls can speak to you in a simulacrum of the caller’s voice, rather than one of the default Gemini voices. But Magic Cue is the most advanced new AI feature which runs locally on your phone and aims to be your little assistant running in the background on your device to proactively help you do things faster on your phone. It combines information from your Google account with multiple data sources on your phone to pop-up suggestions of useful information when using certain Google apps. For instance, it pulled up my order confirmation emails in a little card in the phone app when I called to check where my delivery was, giving me one-tap access to the order number. Or if someone texts about when your flight is due to land, it shows the time and date pulled from your calendar ready to send them with a single tap. The weather app suggests locations for your upcoming trips from your calendar, too. These things don’t sound particularly exciting, but are a step in the right direction for AI away from flashy gimmicks to useful little background time savers. Magic Cue currently works with Gmail, maps, calendar, Keep notes, screenshots, contacts and messages, with Google Photos and a few other Google apps coming soon. The biggest problem is that it doesn’t work in third-party apps yet, so if you use WhatsApp rather than text messages it can’t help you. Camera The Pixel 10 features a 10.5-megapixel selfie and three rear cameras: a 48MP main, 13MP ultra wide and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto. It addresses the main complaint about the base-model Pixel phones, which have lacked a telephoto cameras. The main and ultrawide cameras produce excellent images across a range of lighting conditions, doing better than rivals at this price in higher contrast scenes or dimmer indoor lighting. The new 5x telephoto significantly closes the distance to objects shooting great photos and reaching up to 20x digital zoom if needed. The photos from all three cameras show a little grain when viewed at full crop, but most will be very pleased with them. Google is still the best at reliably producing good images without much thought. The new auto Best Take mode improves on the popular group shot Best Take system by shooting multiple images to automatically blend them together for an image where everyone is looking at the camera. In most photos it won’t have to do too much, but the more people and the more complex the situation, the more the AI intervenes. The popular Add Me feature allows the photographer to be added in to larger and more complex group shots, and has been improved to support larger groups of people, more complex backgrounds and images of pets. The camera app also now adds C2PA content credentials to photos that show how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved. One of the most overtly AI tools is the new Camera Coach feature, which uses Gemini to help you compose and frame a shot for a better picture. Press a small button at the top of the viewfinder and it sends the current view to Google’s servers to analyse and suggest several different possible compositions. Select the one you like the look of and it guides you through the steps of moving the camera, framing the shot and taking the photo. In testing, the suggestions were pretty good, so for anyone interested in improving their photography, this could be a low-key way of getting a bit of help. Overall, the Pixel 10 shoots great photos and videos with generally helpful AI additions, particularly with Best Take and Add Me, but it is possible you end up with images of a moment that may never have actually happened. Sustainability The battery is rated to last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repair with manuals and parts available. The Pixel 10 is contains 32% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free. Price The Google Pixel 10 costs from £799 (€899/$799/A$1,349) in a choice of four colours. For comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro costs from £999, the Pixel 9a costs £399, the Samsung Galaxy S25 costs £799 and the iPhone 16 costs £799. Verdict The Pixel 10 sets a new bar for base-model flagship phones, offering a high-quality experience and great camera with a meaningful telephoto zoom that doesn’t feel like a poor second cousin to the Pro models. The outside has not changed a lot since last year but it is an attractive design that stands out in the sea of rather samey phones, at least from the back. It feels snappy in operation, even if it doesn’t have the fastest chip available, and the battery lasts a decent 1.5 to two days between charges. Some of the new AI features actually seem like meaningful improvements, particularly Magic Cue, auto Best Take and other small bits that run locally in the background while you are doing things. Combined with Gemini, Google is leagues ahead in the era of actually useful AI tools compared with rivals such as Apple, and it doesn’t get in the way of the core smartphone experience. It is not quite the killer bargain of Google’s cheaper Pixel 9a but the Pixel 10 is one of the best phones you can get and great value nonetheless. Pros: seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x telephoto, great screen, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, good battery life, good size, fast fingerprint and face recognition.

But should you?", "date": null, "author": "Tory Shepherd", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "Using a swearword in your Google search can stop that annoying AI overview from popping up. Some apps let you switch off their artificial intelligence. You can choose not to use ChatGPT, to avoid AI-enabled software, to refuse to talk to a chatbot. You can ignore Donald Trump posting deepfakes, and dodge anything with Tilly the AI actor in it. But should you? And can you avoid AI altogether? As the use of AI spreads, so do concerns about its dangers, and resistance to its ubiquitousness. Dr Kobi Leins – an AI management and governance expert – chooses to opt out when medical practitioners want to use AI. She told a specialist she didn’t want AI transcription software used for her child’s appointment but was told it was necessary because the specialist was “time poor” and if she did not want it used she would need to go somewhere else. “You can’t resist individually. There is also systemic resistance. The push from the industry to use these tools above and beyond where it makes sense [is so strong],” she says. Where is AI? AI is spreading inexorably through digital systems. It’s embedded in applications such as ChatGPT, Google’s AI overview, and Elon Musk’s creation Grok, the super-Nazi chatbot. Smartphones, social media and navigation devices are all using it. It has also infiltrated customer service, the finance system, online dating apps and is being used to assess resumes and job applications, rental applications – even legal cases. It’s increasingly part of the healthcare system, easing the administrative burden on doctors and helping to identify illnesses. A global study from the University of Melbourne released in April found half of Australians use AI on a regular or semi-regular basis, but only 36% trust it. Prof Paul Salmon, the deputy director of the University of the Sunshine Coast’s Centre for Human Factors and Sociotechnical Systems, says it’s getting harder and harder to avoid. “In work contexts, there is often pressure to engage with it,” he says. “You either feel like you’re being left behind – or you’re told you’re being left behind.” Should I avoid using AI? Privacy leakage, discrimination, false or misleading information, malicious use in scams and fraud, loss of human agency, lack of transparency and more are just some of the 1,600 risks in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s AI Risk Database. It warns of the risk of AI “pursuing its own goals in conflict with human goals or values” and “possessing dangerous capabilities”. Greg Sadler, the chief executive officer of the Good Ancestors charity and coordinator of Australians for AI Safety, says he often refers to that database and, while AI can be useful, “you definitely don’t want to use AI in the times where you don’t trust its output, or you’re worried about it having the information”. Aside from all those risks, AI has an energy cost. Google’s emissions are up by more than 51% thanks at least in part to the electricity consumption of datacentres that underpin its AI. The International Energy Agency estimates that datacentres’ electricity consumption could double from 2022 levels by 2026, while analysis shows they will be using 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030. How can I avoid using AI? AI overview has a “profanity trigger”. If you ask Google “What is AI?”, its Gemini AI interface will deliver you a potted (and sometimes inaccurate) answer. It’s functioning as an “answer engine” rather than a “search engine”. But if you ask “What the fuck is AI?”, you will be delivered straight search results, linking to other pages. There are various browser extensions that can block AI sites, images and content. You can circumvent some chatbots and speak to a human if you repeatedly say “speak to a human”, use the words “urgent” and “emergency”, or, according to this report, “blancmange” – a sweet dessert popular throughout Europe. James Jin Kang, a senior lecturer in computer science at RMIT University Vietnam, writes in the Conversation that to live entirely without it means “stepping away from much of modern life”. “Why not just add a kill switch?” he asks. The issue, he says, is that it is so embedded in our lives it is “no longer something we can simply turn off”. “So as AI spreads further into every corner of our lives, we must urgently ask: will we still have the freedom to say no? “The question isn’t whether we can live with AI but whether we will still have the right to live without it before it’s too late the break the spell.” What’s the future of AI? Governments around the world, including in Australia, are struggling to keep up with AI, what it means, what it promises and how to govern it. As big tech companies seek access to material including journalism and books to train AI models, the federal government is under pressure to reveal how it plans to regulate the technology. The Conversation has asked five experts where AI is heading. And three out of five of them say AI does not pose an existential risk. Of those who say it doesn’t, Queensland University of Technology’s Aaron J Snoswell says it is “transformative” and the risk isn’t AI becoming too smart, it is “humans making poor choices about how we build and deploy these tools”. CSIRO’s Sarah Vivienne Bentley agrees it is only as good as its users while the University of Melbourne’s Simon Coghlan says despite the concern and hype there is “little evidence that a superintelligent AI capable of wreaking global devastation is coming any time soon”. Australian Catholic University’s Niusha Shafiabady is more grave. She says today’s systems only have limited capacity, but they are gaining capabilities that make misuse more likely to happen at scale, and that it poses an existential threat. Seyedali Mirjalili, an AI professor from Torrens University Australia, says he is “more concerned humans will use AI to destroy civilisation [through militarisation] than AI doing so autonomously by taking over”. Leins says she uses AI tools where it makes sense, but not everywhere. “I know what it does environmentally and I like to write. I have a PhD, I think through my writing,” she says. “It’s about what is evidence based and makes sense. It’s not getting caught up in the hype, and not getting caught up in the doom. “I think we’re complex and smart enough to hold both ideas at the same time – that these tools can be positive or negative.”", "section": "Technology", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

On Monday, Google and Microsoft appeared before a Senate inquiry on a range of age assurance and verification requirements being applied to social media and other aspects of the internet including search. Google’s senior manager of government affairs and public policy in Australia and New Zealand, Rachel Lord, told the inquiry the under-16s ban – which is expected to include YouTube – will have “unintended consequences” and won’t make children safer. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “The legislation will not only be extremely difficult to enforce, it also does not fulfil its promise of making kids safer online,” Lord told the inquiry. “YouTube has invested heavily in designing age-appropriate products and industry leading content controls and tools that allow parents to make choices for their families. “Forcing kids to use YouTube without an account removes the very parental controls and safety filters built to protect them across sport, music, creative learning and classrooms.” The company’s director of government affairs and public policy, Stefanee Lovett, was asked whether Google was lobbying the US government on the matter ahead of the prime minister’s planned visit next week. Lovett said her Google colleagues in the US had been alerted about a “range of issues” being dealt with in Australia, but could not say if the Trump administration was being lobbied. “We’ve noted, senator, that the Australian prime minister will be travelling to the US next week, and we’ve talked to some of our colleagues about a range of issues that we’re dealing with in Australia at the moment, so that they understand the position,” she said, in response to the question from the committee’s chair, Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young. Lord told the committee the ban, due to come into effect on 10 December, would impact safer access to YouTube’s services. She also repeated Google’s claim that YouTube was not social media, but “a video-streaming platform that Australians use as a content library and a learning resource”. Lord said features such as no autoplay, break reminders and turning off personalised advertising would not be available to teens accessing YouTube in a logged-out state once the ban on under-16s holding an account is in effect. Guardian Australia reported earlier this month the grounds in which Google could legally challenge the government over YouTube’s inclusion in the under-16s social media ban. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson sought to clarify whether a legal challenge was still planned, but Lord would not answer directly. “To be clear, at this point in time, we are continuing to speak and engage constructively with the eSafety commissioner and the government on this issue,” Lord said. Henderson said the inclusion of YouTube in the ban was a “betrayal” of young people, given the company had previously been given an exemption by the government when the legislation was developed and passed by the parliament last year. She said the Coalition – which campaigned for the broader under-16s social media ban – was receiving a lot of complaints about YouTube’s inclusion. TikTok, Snap, and Meta were also invited to give evidence at the inquiry but did not appear, despite meeting with the communications minister, Anika Wells, on Monday. Hanson-Young said the inquiry would consider compelling the companies to appear. Yahoo, age assurance providers, the eSafety commissioner, the privacy commissioner, and digital rights and youth advocacy groups will appear before the committee on Monday.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

The vulpines have taken over the rooftop garden of the new “landscraper” in King’s Cross and had an impact on construction – although the company stressed it was “minimal”. The incursion, first reported by the newsletter London Centric, was confirmed by sources familiar with the construction. One told the Guardian it had been a rolling three-year saga and said some foxes had begun to dig burrows in the perfectly manicured grounds. “There’s a little hole in the garden where one lives,” they said. “We’ve seen her all around the building – one second she’s on the fifth floor, the next she’s on the garden floor. No one has been able to catch her.” Others said they have seen fox poo on the grounds of the Thomas Heatherwick-designed building. Mosh Latifi, a co-director of the London-based pest control firm EcoCare, said they could be living off rats. “Foxes thrive quite well on rodents – we don’t live more than three metres away from the nearest rat,” he said, adding that he had also witnessed foxes in building sites scouring for food left behind by workers. Leaky pipes, or even generous handouts from local businesses, could be sustaining the skulk, according to another London pest control expert, who did not wish to be named. “London is a big playground for foxes – they will go absolutely anywhere,” they said. A Google spokesperson said: “Fox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King’s Cross development is no exception. While foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.” According to a search using the firm’s own search engine, the best way to get rid of foxes is to remove food sources, install secure fencing and fill in any gaps. It is not the first time a pricey London building has had such a problem. In 2011, a fox called Romeo was discovered living in the Shard. He survived by living off scraps left by construction workers. Romeo was captured and, after a checkup, released back on to the streets of London. Facebook had to contend with a family of foxes at its Menlo Park headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area. They were eventually honoured on the social media site – being granted a set of stickers on its Messenger app. Plans for the new Google building were announced in 2013, as its first completely owned and designed company site outside the US. The 11-storey building will accommodate up to 7,000 employees. The 300-metre rooftop garden runs along the length of the building and encompasses the seventh to eleventh floors. It’s believed that 40,000 tonnes of soil has been brought to support 250 trees, with a running track winding through them. The garden was designed to accommodate bees, bats, birds and butterflies. It features a space for dining, deckchairs and a fitness area. It also has an indoor pool. The nearly 1m sq ft building has been under construction since 2018, and is estimated to be completed later this year. In 2022, a topping-off ceremony that featured non-alcoholic Pimm’s and luxury canapés was attended by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and Keir Starmer, whose Holborn and St Pancras constituency includes the office. “This project represents a real vote of confidence in London, in our communities and in our flourishing tech sector,” Khan said at the time. • This article was amended on 10 June 2025 to refer to foxes as vulpines rather than canines, and to remove references to them as pests; they are officially classed as wild animals, not pests or vermin. Also, Menlo Park is in the San Francisco Bay Area, not San Francisco itself.", "section": "UK news", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

FIEG, the Italian federation of newspaper publishers, said it has submitted a formal complaint to Agcom, Italy’s communications watchdog. Similar complaints have been filed in other EU countries. Coordinated by the European Newspaper Publishers’ Association, the aim is to push the European Commission to open an investigation against Google under the EU Digital Services Act. The threat posed by AI Overviews, which gives users information without them having to click through to the original source by summarising searches with a block of text at the top of the results page, is among the main concerns of European news outlets. FIEG said it was also worried about the more recent AI Mode, which takes information from multiple sources and presents them as a chatbot. The federation argues that the Google services “violate fundamental provisions of the digital services act, with detrimental effects on Italian users, consumers and businesses”. “Google is becoming a traffic killer,” FIEG said in a statement, adding that the products not only directly compete with content produced by publishing firms, but also “reduces their visibility and discoverability, and thus their advertising revenues”. “This has serious consequences for the economic sustainability and diversity of the media, with all the risks associated with a lack of transparency and the proliferation of disinformation in democratic debate,” the statement said. A study published in July by the UK-based Authoritas analytics company claimed AI Overviews, launched by Google last year, caused up to 80% fewer clickthroughs. The research, which was submitted as part of a legal complaint to the UK’s competition watchdog about the impact of Google AI Overviews, also found that links to YouTube – owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet – were more prominent compared with the normal search result system. A second study by the Pew Research Center, a US thinktank, also showed a big hit to referral traffic from Google AI Overviews, with users only clicking a link under an AI summary once every 100 times. Google claimed the studies were inaccurate and based on flawed methodology. Google AI Overviews arrived in Italy in March. In September, the country became the first in the EU to approve a comprehensive law regulating the use of artificial intelligence, including limiting child access and imposing prison terms on those who use the technology to cause harm, such as generating deepfakes. Giorgia Meloni’s government described the legislation, which aligns with the EU’s landmark AI Act, as a decisive move in influencing how AI is used across Italy.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

This is the company’s first earnings report since Donald Trump levied tariffs on trade partners around the world. Despite the upheaval for Alphabet, it exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, reporting revenue of $90.23bn, up 12% since the same time last year, and $2.81 in earnings per share. Analysts had projected first quarter revenue of $89.2bn and earnings of $2.01 per share, according to consensus estimates. The global tariffs were not expected to create much of an impact for Alphabet, since they were mostly instituted after the end of the quarter. Alphabet’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said the first quarter results “reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business” and that underpinning this growth is the company’s emphasis on artificial intelligence. Alphabet’s stock jumped more than 7% in after hours trading. Alphabet is one of the world’s most valuable companies, worth nearly $2trn. But economic headwinds that include high tariffs and possible trade wars, along with various legal battles brought by governments worldwide, could eventually hit the tech behemoth. Google is “not immune to the macro environment”, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. He added that Google’s ads business could be effected by Trump’s decision to end the de minimis trade loophole on 2 May, which allows for duty-free shipments to the US for items less than $800. But, Schindler said, “we have a lot of experience in managing through uncertain times.” Earlier this week, Google returned to court in Washington DC for the conclusion of a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice. The government sued Google in 2020 alleging it acted illegally to maintain a monopoly of the search engine market. The justice department won that case after a trial last year and now the two parties are in court again to decide whether Google will be forced to break off parts of its company, including its Chrome browser. In a blogpost on Sunday, Google’s vice-president of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, wrote that the justice department’s lawsuit “is a backwards-looking case at a time of intense competition and unprecedented innovation” and said that the company will appeal. Japan and the European Union have also alleged that Alphabet has broken the law by operating an illegal monopoly with its search engine practices. In a separate justice department antitrust lawsuit, which wrapped last week, a federal judge ruled that Google had illegally monopolized some of its online advertising technology. Google has said it will also appeal the “adverse” portion of this ruling. Advertising is Google’s core business, making up about 75% of its total revenue, according to Statista. That number has fallen 13% since 2017 though, and the company says it’s working on shifting its ads business to emphasize more artificial intelligence tools and capabilities for marketers. Artificial intelligence is a huge growth area for Alphabet, as it faces competition from companies such as Microsoft, OpenAI and China’s DeepSeek. In its last earnings report in February, Alphabet said it planned to spend $75bn on capital expenditures in 2025, which will mostly be used to expand its AI capabilities and infrastructure. Investors have been looking at how the company is integrating the technology into its suite of services, including Google Search, YouTube and Google Cloud. On Thursday, Pichai touted the company’s growth in AI, saying features such as its AI Overview tool on Google Search has seen a boost in users.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

Try Google Maps", "date": null, "author": "Alan Vaarwerk", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "There is a certain kind of guy who looks at Google Maps for fun. I am that guy. As a kid I went through a cartography phase, drawing elaborate maps of fictional islands and poring over the family street directory in an effort to reconcile the lines and dots on the overcrowded pages with the streets, shops and friends’ houses in my mind’s eye. You could say that phase never really ended. In much the same way as some people will pull up a movie’s IMDb entry the second they start watching, any time I come across an interesting town, country or geographical oddity (which is often in the news business), I’m firing up Maps to see what topographical morsels I can uncover. I’m no GeoGuessr savant, but I’ve spent many pleasant hours puzzling over interesting enclaves and panhandles, or pootling around far-flung locales in Street View. After finishing a recent episode of Severance I opened a tab and took an armchair tour through the remote Newfoundland island where it was shot. I’m not exactly uncovering some mysterious corner of the internet here. Google Maps is so ubiquitous it’s become a utility – admitting I open it for fun feels like extolling the virtues of the Calendar app, or calling up Centrelink just to enjoy the hold music. There are plenty of other perfectly decent navigation apps out there – but Google Maps’ special sauce is its mountain of user-generated data. The key to Google Maps’ power is its volunteer workforce of obsessive “local guides”. Clicking on these profiles feels vaguely illicit, like you’re tracking them for Asio. These are the users who log their every move, amassing hundreds of reviews of everything from restaurants to payphones, detailing opening hours, accessibility features and taking some of the worst food photography you’ve ever seen. I do not understand these people and their currency of points and badges, but I am grateful for them. There is a man who has reviewed every public postbox in Ballarat and had opinions about them all. My nearest bus stop has a 3.3-star rating and a single review: “It’s just a bus stop.” OK! Some Google Maps discoveries feel like stumbling into someone else’s private joke. Not far from my girlfriend’s house, an unremarkable piece of tarmac has been dubbed “Tristan’s Roundabout” – its reviews tab populated with tourist selfies and comically overblown praise for the intersection and the eponymous Tristan, who responds to each reviewer in equally effusive terms. In the surrounding streets you can find reviewers waxing lyrical over such local sights as a hole in the ground or abandoned trailer, and writing glowing tributes to a friendly orange cat named Flumpy. Passing these waypoints as I move around the neighbourhood feels like a digital scavenger hunt – an act of noticing and recording the small quirks of suburban life. This is where the real joy of Google Maps lies: in the moments when you get to see humans being playful with the otherwise prosaic tools at their disposal. It’s in the social media bots showcasing random restaurants and new towns every hour, pegged to Google Maps data. It’s in people using Street View to stave off homesickness or hold on to those they’ve lost, or using Google’s all-but-abandoned My Maps tool to share lists of publicly accessible fruit trees. It’s the instances where some kind of bug or human error leads to an Indonesian supermarket appearing in Antarctica – a reminder that these tools can be messy and imperfect, just like us. Maps are loaded with political and imperialist symbolism, and Google is arguably more responsible for the dire state of the internet than most. I’m sure the product managers are, at this moment, brainstorming ways to shoehorn ever more AI slop into our maps. But for now, when the internet feels like a constant stream of noise, it’s nice to unwind by going for a leisurely scroll around the neighbourhood.", "section": "Culture", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

Spread across 52 hectares (128 acres), the Thurrock “hyperscale datacentre” will be part of a wave of mammoth computer and AI power houses if it secures planning consent. The plans were submitted by a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and the carbon impact emerged before a concerted push by Donald Trump’s White House and Downing Street to ramp up AI capacity in Britain. Multibillion-dollar investment deals with some of Silicon Valley’s biggest tech companies are expected to be announced during the US president’s state visit to the UK, which starts on Tuesday. Keir Starmer’s government has forecast a 13-fold rise in the amount of computer processing power AI will use by 2035 and is scrambling to supply the datacentres to meet that demand in the hope the technology will boost Britain’s insipid economic productivity. Deals involving Nvidia, the world’s largest AI chip maker, and OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT AI assistant, are anticipated. But campaigners have said a wave of massive new computer warehouses will crank up Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions and put pressure on finite power and water resources. If allowed, the Thurrock complex will include up to four datacentres on “grey belt” land part-occupied by a former speedway and stock car track. It “will lead to a net increase in GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions of 568,727 tonnes CO₂е [carbon dioxide equivalent] per year during the operational phase”, planning documents examined by the Guardian show. That amounts to about 500 flights from Heathrow to Málaga every week, according to the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization’s carbon calculator. Google’s planning application stresses this remains a “minor adverse and not significant impact when compared to the UK carbon budgets”, but campaigners disagree. “Google’s planned facility in Essex will produce carbon emissions several times higher than those of an international airport,” said a spokesperson for Foxglove, a campaign group for fairer technology. “But this is just one of many ‘hyperscale’ datacentres that US big tech wants to impose on the UK – in pursuit of their own profits and regardless of the cost to our environment. “Starmer’s government needs to stop bowing to the Trump-big tech agenda and start standing up for the interests of the UK public – otherwise we will all be paying for the tech giants’ datacentres, whether in terms of soaring energy bills, dwindling water supplies or a heating planet.” Datacentres now consume about 2.5% of the UK’s electricity, and demand on the grid is expected to increase fourfold by 2030, according to the House of Commons library. The British government does not believe datacentres will have a significant impact on the UK’s carbon budget because of its ambitious targets for electricity grid decarbonisation. Rather it is worried that without massive investment in new datacentres, the UK will fall behind international rivals, including France, resulting in a “compute gap” that “risks undermining national security, economic growth, and the UK’s ambition to lead in AI”, according to a July research paper from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. Other important datacentre projects include a £10bn scheme on the site of a former coal-fired power station near Blyth in Northumberland that was granted planning permission in March. It is poised to be at the heart of a UK-US deal involving Nvidia and OpenAI. It was also reported at the weekend that Google is in early-stage talks about building a mammoth datacentre on Teesside. Bain &amp; Company, a global business consultancy, said on Monday that AI and datacentres could account for 2% of global emissions and 17% of industrial emissions by 2035, with the impact highest in countries where fossil fuels still dominate power generation. Google declined to comment on its planning application for the Thurrock site. On Teesside, it said: “We do not comment on rumours or speculation.”", "section": "Technology", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

With this, Google joins a slew of US businesses, particularly in Silicon Valley, that have been scaling back their diversity initiatives, years after pushing for more inclusive policies after protests against the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans in 2020. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. The company issued a statement after the news broke: “We’re committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we’ve been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there. We’ve updated our 10-k language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.” Alphabet’s annual filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday showed it omitted a line saying it was “committed to making diversity, equity and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve”. That statement had appeared in annual reports from 2021 to 2023. Google told employees it was reviewing recent court decisions and executive orders by Donald Trump aimed at curbing DEI in the government and federal contractors. Google’s head of HR, Fiona Cicconi, said in a memo published by the Verge: “For example, in 2020, we set aspirational hiring goals and focused on growing our offices outside California and New York to improve representation … In the future we will no longer have aspirational goals.” Earlier this month, Facebook parent Meta Platforms said in an internal memo it was ending its DEI programs, including those for hiring, training and picking suppliers. Amazon also said it was “winding down outdated programs and materials” related to representation and inclusion, in a memo to its employees, seen by Reuters. Conservative groups, fortified by a 2023 US supreme court ruling that invalidated affirmative action in university admissions, have condemned DEI programs and have threatened litigation against companies implementing them. Earlier this month, Elon Musk and other allies of Trump attributed DEI programs as an impediment to the response efforts for the severe wildfires in Los Angeles.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the largest slab phone Google makes and is one of the biggest available in Europe and the US. It costs £1,199 (€1,299/$1,199/A$1,999), sitting above its smaller sibling the Pixel 10 Pro and below the upcoming folding Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and competing directly with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro Max and Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra. The 10 Pro XL is almost identical on the outside to the 9 Pro XL it replaces in terms of dimensions but with 11g of additional weight. It is a big, heavy phone that requires two hands to use most of the time and benefits from a phone grip or handle. It has a huge, bright and smooth OLED screen, which is one of the very best and excellent for watching TV and films. The back hides Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, making it one of a very small number of phones that can charge at up to 25W using a new generation of wireless chargers. The 10 Pro XL has the same Google Tensor G5 chip as the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup and performs just as well, feeling rapid in general use. It plays games just fine, but those wanting the best graphics and frame rates in high-end mobile games are better served by rivals with Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon chip, such as the S25 Ultra. The biggest Pixel also has the largest battery with the longest run time. The 10 Pro XL matches its predecessor, lasting about 52 hours between charges after a mix of usage across wifi and 5G. The phone should outlast even the heaviest of usage days, with most people probably needing to charge it every other day.

Google will provide updates until 2032. The Gemini chatbot is available throughout the system, and has its own stand-alone app that can see what is on your screen or through the camera to help. But the standout new feature is Magic Cue, which runs locally in the background as a proactive little helper presenting data from your calendar, emails, chats and other Google apps on your phone when you need it. It will pop up with the location of a restaurant when a friend texts about your dinner date or shows your order emails in the phone app when you ring a recognised business. It works great in Google’s various apps, and a handful of third-party ones, but not WhatsApp or other popular messaging apps yet. The 10 Pro XL also comes with a year’s subscription for Google AI Pro, for access to the company’s more powerful Gemini models, and 2TB of cloud storage for photos, files and email, worth £19 a month. Camera The big Pixel has the same camera system as the 10 Pro, meaning your choice is only about phone size not camera quality. The 50-megapixel main, 48MP ultra wide and 48MP 5x telephoto cameras are some of the very best you can get. Point and shoot with the 10 Pro XL and you are almost guaranteed a great shot regardless of the conditions. It also has a handful of helpful AI tools including: the novel Camera Coach; Add Me, which blends two photos to put the photographer into group shots; and Best Take, which has now been made automatic. It helps get group shots where everyone is looking at the camera by shooting a photo when everyone is looking once you press the shutter button or blending multiple shots where needed. Finally, it has the Pro Res Zoom feature that kicks in when you push beyond 30x magnification and uses genAI to put the detail and sharpness back into images lost to digital zoom. It isn’t always perfect and is switched off when the system detects a person, but it can have remarkable results, making blurry 100x zoom images much clearer and more usable. But it is also not a true photo at that point, as it has been interpreted and remade by AI, and is labelled as such by the camera app using C2PA content credentials. Overall, whether you use the AI tools or not, the Pixel has one of the very best camera systems on the market. Sustainability The battery is rated to last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops, or self-repair using manuals and parts available. The Pixel 10 Pro XL contains 29% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free. Price The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL costs from £1,199 (€1,299/$1,199/A$1,999) in a choice of four colours. For comparison, the Pixel 10 costs from £799, the Pixel 10 Pro from £999, the Pixel 9a costs £399, the Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,249 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs £1,199. Verdict The Pixel 10 Pro XL is a true superphone in size, price and capability. If you like what Google’s been doing with 6.3in smartphones but want everything bigger, this is the model to get. The camera is one of the very best, the screen is great and the software, including Google’s most cutting-edge AI features, is top notch. The addition of Qi2.2 support speeds up wireless charging, but more helpfully opens up a world of magnetic accessories including grips to make the big phone easier to hold. The Pixel feels responsive but it isn’t a dramatic upgrade on last year’s 9 Pro XL model. When it comes to raw power, particularly for games, the Pixel falls short against rivals such as the Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra, which remains the superphone to beat. Pros: seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, great big screen, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2.2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, good battery life, great size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included. Cons: very expensive, huge and heavy, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical Sim card slot in the US, not a massive upgrade.", "section": "Technology", "query": "Google", "companies": ["Google"]}

Once a term only used by nutritionists and food policy researchers to describe the most processed foods in the supply chain (think: chips and sodas, packaged bread, microwave dinners and even some yogurts), ultra-processing has become a calling card of the “Make America Healthy Again” (“Maha”) movement. The movement, which is focused on addressing “America’s escalating health crisis” by investigating food, pharmaceuticals, vaccines and environmental contaminants (and has frequently platformed pseudoscience), found a home in Donald Trump’s administration after Kennedy endorsed the president. Indeed, during his confirmation hearings to become head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy called ultra-processed foods “poison” and the main culprit of the United States’s “chronic disease epidemic”. Many food experts were surprised, and grateful, to find an ally in Trump’s administration. Today, ultra-processed foods make up 73% of the US food supply and are linked to a range of health conditions including diabetes, obesity, depression and certain cancers. Despite this rhetoric, experts are skeptical that ultra-processed foods will go anywhere. Rather than reining in ultra-processing, the Trump administration’s food policy has mostly undermined Maha’s stated goals. Calling out the ‘root cause of all this sickness and death’ The first report of the Maha commission made headlines in May when it raised concerns about a “chronic disease crisis” in children. Echoing language that Kennedy campaigned on, the report argued that “the American diet has shifted dramatically toward ultra-processed foods” and that “nearly 70% of children’s calories now come from UPFs, contributing to obesity, diabetes, and other chronic conditions”. (The report also received criticism for including fake citations, though those in the food policy sections appeared accurate.) Those are concerns that food policy experts share – and the report listed many expert-backed solutions to rein in ultra-processing. “The greatest step the United States can take to reverse childhood chronic disease is to put whole foods produced by American farmers and ranchers at the center of healthcare,” the report found. It went on to describe the dismal state of nutrition research in the United States: “Government funding for nutrition research through the NIH is only 4-5% of its total budget and in some cases is subject to influence by food industry-aligned researchers.” It is “extraordinary” how quickly Kennedy’s Maha commission has “made chronic disease, specifically big food” a political priority, said Jerold Mande, a nutrition professor at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and a former food policymaker who served under Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. “It’s a bit breathtaking and refreshing to see this administration put out a report where they just clearly say a root cause of all of this sickness and death is the industry.” As head of the Maha commission, Kennedy has also promised to introduce regulatory reforms, including phasing out synthetic food dyes, ending a loophole for untested food additives, introducing a new regulatory program and restricting how supplemental food funding is spent. Under Kennedy’s direction, the Food and Drug Administration has begun asking companies to voluntarily stop using six common food dyes, and outright banned two others. Food policy advocates have long called for greater regulations on synthetic dyes, and some states, most notably California, have already begun banning certain dyes. Kennedy has ordered the FDA to explore how to eliminate a policy that allows food companies to decide themselves whether food additives are safe, called the Generally Recognized as Safe (Gras) loophole. “That’s a really, really big deal,” says Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “Ninety-nine per cent of compounds in food were added through this loophole.” In May, the FDA and National Institutes of Health also announced a new joint Nutrition Regulatory Science Program (plans to form such a program were finalized under the Biden administration). In recent weeks, the program issued requests for research proposals specifically tied to two themes: contaminants in school meals and exercise (food companies have emphasized the individual responsibility to exercise as a distraction from reformulating food). Meanwhile, at Kennedy’s encouragement, several states are also pursuing policies that would limit spending from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) on “junk food”. To date, the federal government has approved waivers for six states to ban such purchases. Mande thinks that’s an effective strategy to motivate food companies to reformulate their products. “Snap is just by far the biggest lever the government has that the food companies are going to do what Snap policy requires of them,” he said. How Trump ‘hijacked the food movement’ Despite the Maha report and other recent moves by Kennedy to call out ultra-processed food and its role in the chronic disease crisis, some food policy experts warn that the administration’s actions are undermining that goal. That came into focus earlier this year when Trump appointed several nominees who favored deregulatory policies, or had outright ties to the food industry, to his cabinet. One of the key ways to rein in ultra-processing is to make sure that youth have access to fresh produce, says Mande. Yet the administration has slashed the very programs that do that. In March, Trump’s agriculture department cut a host of previously approved grants, including the Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grant and Local Food for Schools and Childcare program, which paid farmers and ranchers to supply schools with local foods and build gardens. Those cuts don’t only harm schools, but farmers as well, says Marion Nestle, a professor emerita at New York University and author of the book Food Politics. Mozaffarian called the choice to cut the Farm to School Grant “a bizarre decision that goes completely against the goals to make America healthy again”. Nestle believes that misalignment between promise and practice is purposeful. The Trump administration and Maha movement have “hijacked the food movement in order to use it as publicity for the kind of cuts that are being made”, she said. It’s also being used to “forward an agenda which is exactly the opposite of what you would hope” – one that’s focused more on cutting programs than reforming industry. Nestle says the administration’s calls to end subsidies for “junk food” with Snap are disingenuous, and just a guise for cutting the program altogether. “The business about taking sodas out of Snap is a cover for cutting Snap benefits,” she said. The current Republican budget bill, which Trump signed into law last week, proposes a 20% cut to the program. In addition to increasing access to fresh produce, the other most effective way to tackle ultra-processed foods, Mande says, is robust industry regulation – which also hasn’t happened. “It’s become a pattern that they announce ambitious plans, they say a lot of the right things about what the problem is and what we broadly need to do about it, but the specifics are either missing or really not properly aligned to the task,” said Mande. “It’s still early, but it’s happened repeatedly enough to be concerning.” The Trump administration’s announcements about combatting food dyes and additives, for instance, have not been paired with specific plans or funding details or regulations. “Historically, Republican administrations have been reluctant to use some levers of government, particularly funding and regulation, to advance policy, but there is no way to tackle this issue successfully and effectively without funding and regulations,” said Mande. “At each juncture, when one would expect or hope to see funding or regulation as a step to achieving a policy that they played out, they haven’t done that.” Even with funding, Nestle wonders how effective those reforms will be “when the FDA’s workforce has been decimated”. In April, the Department of Health and Human Services laid off 10,000 workers, about an eighth of its workforce. More than a third of those fired were at the Food and Drug Administration. In the wake of those layoffs, the National Institutes of Health’s leading nutrition researcher, Kevin Hall, opted to take an early retirement offer. Hall has conducted one of the most cited studies on ultra-processed foods, which found that people who ate an ultra-processed diet consumed nearly 500 calories more a day than those who did not, and had other projects in the pipeline. “Unfortunately, recent events have made me question whether NIH continues to be a place where I can freely conduct unbiased science,” Hall wrote in a social media post announcing his decision. In an interview with the New York Times, Hall described multiple incidents where NIH officials censored his work, including altering his responses to journalists and asking him to remove language about “health equity” from his research (he opted to remove his name from the paper instead). In May, he told Stat News that he was unlikely to return to the scientific agency. What’s ahead That said, Mozaffarian believes there are still powerful ways the Trump administration could regulate ultra-processed foods with minimal staff or funding. Funding and a plan are key to making that work successful, he said, but if that’s not possible, the agency could take other actions. He suggests three such alternatives for ending the Gras loophole: requiring “public notice and public disclosure of all the safety data that would then be put on a searchable public database” that other groups, like academics and consumer watchdogs, could review themselves; implement stricter standards for which foods are allowed to call themselves “generally recognized as safe”; or adopt the food regulations of other countries, such as Europe, Australia, New Zealand or Canada which have already banned “many substances that are allowed in the US”. Nestle is more skeptical that incremental change could tackle ultra-processing and chemicals in the food supply. Addressing color additives, for example, she says is a “no-brainer” because companies are already “using alternatives in Australia and New Zealand.” What could be more difficult is getting other chemicals out of food, like the mercury, arsenic and other heavy metals emitted by coal-burning power plants that also contaminate soil and waterways. “Nobody has ever been able to get coal-burning power plants to clean up their emissions” and in fact the Trump administration has directed the Environmental Protection Agency to relax controls on those emissions, she adds. “There’s no policy here.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Nestle", "companies": ["Nestle"]}

The US health secretary appeared at an enormous food plant in Oklahoma for a company called Mom’s Meals, which makes 1.5m “medically tailored” meals each week and ships them all over the country. Companies including Mom’s Meals have been criticized for hijacking the “food is medicine” movement by providing “salty, fat-laden” meals to the ill and elderly, paid for by health insurance companies. “This is really one of the solutions for making our country healthy again,” Kennedy said in a video posted to the his social media account. Kennedy visited Mom’s Meals to celebrate Republican Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt’s Food Is Medicine Act, which allows the state’s Medicaid program to purchase such meals. Nutritionists told the Guardian that the company’s menus contain ultra-processed ingredients and could be healthier. The Associated Press first reported nutritionists’ concerns with Kennedy’s promotion of the company. “We can do better and there are lots of meal programs that do better, and they don’t have any of those kinds of ingredients in there,” said Marion Nestle, emerita professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, told the Guardian. “It’s the texturizers and even the natural colors. It’s got all this stuff in it that food companies put into foods to make up for the fact the ingredients aren’t fresh.” Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard’s TH Chan School of Public Health, gave the meals a “C” grade in comments via email. Willet, who is generally skeptical of the utility of the ultra-processed label, said: “These meals could be ultra-processed but be much healthier.” Teresa Roof, a spokesperson for Mom’s Meals, said the organisation works “continuously to ensure the quality of our meals, which are designed by registered dietitians and professional chefs to meet condition-specific medical guidelines including those from the American Heart Association, National Kidney Foundation, American Diabetes Association, and the National Institutes of Health. “The question at hand is the definition of ultra-processed foods. Mom’s Meals does not produce any meals containing ingredients commonly found in ultra-processed foods. This means no: synthetic food dyes, added MSG, high fructose corn syrup, non-nutritive sweeteners (eg sucralose), partially hydrogenated oils or added trans fats, and synthetic preservatives banned in EU.” Ultra-processed foods generally include ingredients you wouldn’t use in your home kitchen – such as stabilizers, gums and anti-sticking agents to name a couple in Mom’s Meals’ cheese tortellini meal. It also includes cooking processes you wouldn’t use at home, such as molding and extrusion. There is a growing body of evidence that shows ultra-processed foods encourage people to eat more calories and are linked to obesity and diabetes. A recent study found these foods account for more than half of all the calories Americans eat. Food researchers are still studying exactly why ultra-processed foods prompt people to eat more. The definition of ultra-processed, and its utility as a category, is a subject of debate in nutrition research circles. The meaning of the phrase has become increasingly controversial lawmakers have proposed bills attempting to reign in food processors. The phrase “ultra-processed” has come into wide usage since Kennedy began painting it as the boogeyman of the US food system, criticizing the industrialized processes as “poisoning the American people” in his confirmation hearing. His agency is also planning a “bold, edgy” public relations campaign to warn Americans about the dangers of such foods. “Why he would pick on these meals as being the solution to America’s food problems – I have no idea,” said Nestle. “But ones that are made with better ingredients and don’t have all the junk in them would cost more, and they’d probably have to be shipped frozen.” Notably, the state act comes after Republicans and Donald Trump signed a mega bill to cut $1tn out of Medicaid and $186bn from government food supports, colloquially known as “food stamps”, over the next decade. Medicaid is a public health insurance program that covers 71 million low-income, disabled and elderly Americans. This is not the first time Kennedy has made a controversial choice of companies to promote. In March, he visited Steak ‘n Shake, a burger and fries restaurant, where he praised the company’s use of beef tallow in fryers and made inflammatory statements about vaccines.", "section": "US news", "query": "Nestle", "companies": ["Nestle"]}

Quaint isn’t a word I use often, but nor do I eat at many places with a spacious upstairs bar area that doubles as a yoga studio. Go for the spice bag potatoes with tropea onions and roast chilli, stay for the 45-minute flow yoga with Amanda. Actually, scrap that: do not even dream of pulling shapes after eating too many spiced onions. Leave it a couple of hours. Still, whatever it is that chef Tobias Godfrey and his co-owner and partner, Laura Day, are offering, the locals are clearly loving it, because on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago, the place was orderly bedlam. Word has clearly spread that Fête was last month named runner-up restaurant of the year in Essex Life’s 2025 food and drink awards, and ladies wearing Friday-night tops were dining in droves and ordering rounds of matcha margaritas and maple martinis. Fête’s road to taking the Chelmsford dining scene by storm has been largely ignored by nearby trendy London, which is a scene that celebrates only itself. Essex is only a few miles away, but the great and the good are scarred by too many stories of local restaurants boasting helium balloon arches, bottomless brunches, walls of plastic greenery and Gemma from Towie drinking Aperol spritz, not to mention too many old-fashioned, and definitely “old hat” country pubs serving venison on celeriac puree to lads with new hair from Turkey. The cool, metropolitan crowd avoid these places unless a London chef takes the helm. For what it’s worth, I love both these aspects of Essex, which may explain why I was so pleasantly jollied by Fête’s eclectic menu, where Taiwanese chicken bao sits side by side with Kashmiri scallops, and where duck-fried rice with kimchi and mac and cheese with guanciale nestle cosily together on the small plates menu, all casual like, as if they aren’t from entirely different continents. Perhaps Fête, which is open all day, and serves this lengthier, more complex menu on Friday and Saturday evenings, has caused such a stir because it absolutely dares to be different, focusing on big, hearty, pan-global flavours, rather than any narrow theme. For so-called “small plates”, the portions are whopping, too, and we ordered far too much. Take the bowl of pale, wobbly, balm-like burrata laden with figs and hot honey, which also featured generous amounts of pistachio and layers of beetroot, and came with a slab of sourdough toast. Next up, a giant-sized beef tartare, made rather strangely with wholly unnecessary mayo, that had a great, acidic bite of capers and cornichons, and turned up on another big slice of bread. Godfrey clearly sets out to throw as much flavour on a plate as possible, so this tartare also came with crispy kale and wobbly egg yolk. The idea of that duck-fried rice proved irresistible and was, again, ridiculously generous, and came topped with a fried egg, kimchi, XO sauce, chilli and kimchi furikake. One cannot doubt Godfrey’s devotion to taking his customers on a whistle-stop tour of the entire culinary cosmos, but hang on to your hats for the gear changes when your battered sausages with mustard are followed by a Taiwanese bao with a side of winter tomatoes in cashew cream. There’s something so endearingly adventurous and devil-may-care about this menu that makes me love the place. The front-of-house are jolly, friendly and, above all, clearly happy. The kitchen zings with an enthusiasm that speaks of a bunch of mates having the time of their lives, and who can’t quite believe that their dream of serving scallops in Kashmiri curry alongside a French-style vegan courgette cassoulet is actually paying dividends, and that they’ve become the hottest place for miles around as a result. Is the cooking perfect? No. By doing so much on every plate, there are flaws, and tweaks to be made, if you’re being picky. A piece of kingfish with burnt butter, preserved lemon and capers, for instance, was overcooked and the mega-chunk of beef tartare wasn’t hugely balanced. Yet I was still smiling by the time we were handed the dessert list and its banana parfait, sticky toffee pudding and house sorbet, before opting for the chocolate fondant with honeycomb and burnt butter ice-cream. Sure, by this point, we’d eaten far too much, but we still found room for this piece of hedonism. Fête is a welcome slice of unpretentious hospitality happiness. The only way isn’t Essex, but if it were, I wouldn’t complain. Fête 10-13 Grays Brewery Yard, Chelmsford, Essex, hello@fetegraysyard.co.uk (no phone).

There was little to see here at Villa Park. Or get excited about. England beat Andorra, as they always do. They did not concede against them, as always. And Thomas Tuchel’s record in World Cup qualifying Group K now shows the maximum number of points from four ties – and four clean sheets. The manager had talked about bringing greater aggression; more speed and penetration, helped by a cleaner and simpler approach. But it was not a game that demanded intense analysis. Rather it was one to tick off and move on from. It was better than the away fixture against Andorra, which was played in Barcelona in June, when England grubbed home by the only goal after a flat performance, hearing boos at half-time and full-time. But long before this one was over, the thoughts of most supporters had begun to turn to the tie against Serbia in Belgrade on Tuesday. That promises to be hostile; the acid test of qualification. Tuchel had likened the challenge of getting through Andorra’s low block to chewing gum. In other words, deeply monotonous, something to make your face muscles ache. Noni Madueke forced an own goal from the Andorra defender, Christian García, midway through the first half and Declan Rice made it 2-0 midway through the second. The statistics showed that Andorra touched the ball four times inside the England area. The number was five in June. It was attack versus defence throughout, almost like a training session. The international break for England was always going to be all about Serbia. Tuchel had sought to set the tone by going with his strongest possible lineup, one that featured players in their very best positions as he sees it, although there were exceptions. The manager had suggested Dan Burn and Marc Guéhi were in competition at left centre-half. He started both, Guéhi preferred to Ezri Konsa in the right-sided role. Rice and Elliot Anderson are the No 8s in the squad. Tuchel put them both in, too, giving the latter his debut as the No 6. In possession, England were more 4-3-3 than 4-2-3-1, Eberechi Eze in a right-sided No 8 position, Rice to his left. No prizes for guessing how Andorra set up – in a resolute 5-4-1. Tuchel had actually described them on Friday as using a 5-5-0 system. How do the people of Andorra live these ties? Do they even watch? Because there is literally nothing from their team; zero adventure. They have been managed by the same manager, Koldo Álvarez, for the last 15 years. He does what he does. They do what they do. Then again, this is a nation of 82,000 – roughly the same population as Ashford in Kent. England needed a goal before the half hour mark, the point at which it was possible to wonder whether the crowd might grow frustrated. They got it. Anderson was lively, looking to progress the ball and he sparked a move that got Madueke into a crossing position. The right winger floated it over towards Rice, who had made a late run for the six-yard box, and it came off the head of García to nestle inside the far corner. Tuchel watched, at times, from a seated position on top of a Lucozade drinks cooler. Where was the energy, Thomas! But he celebrated the breakthrough with aggressively clenched fists. Relief was a part of it. Madueke has Bukayo Saka for competition; Saka is among the posse of injured players to miss this window. And Madueke was game, direct; he tried to make things happen. He had teed up Eze for a shot in the 15th minute, which ended up too close to the goalkeeper, Iker Álvarez. Eze saw another one cleared off the line on 23 minutes by Max Llovera after a cut-back from Rice. It was thin gruel in the first half, England not sharp enough. The tempo was missing. It was sideways stuff, too often. At least they were not booed off by the sell-out crowd. The fans’ commitment was hugely impressive. It always is. England pushed after the restart and they looked more creative. Eze worked the goalkeeper after a Madueke burst while Marcus Rashford bent the follow-up wide. Anderson went close after Harry Kane had helped to force a turnover high up, a potential moment to cherish denied by Álvarez’s diving save. Eze lashed high when well placed but the offside flag had gone up – it was not his day – before Rice scored the second with a downwards header from Reece James’s cross.", "section": "Football", "query": "Nestle", "companies": ["Nestle"]}

A perky wren on the drystone wall, a grey wagtail bobbing along the fence, long-tailed tits dancing through the hawthorn. There are binoculars ready on different windowsills. Now it’s something as ordinary as a mallard, but it feels intimate to watch the building of a nest from scratch. A pair has been pottering about the garden for a few days and I’ve woken to the sound of raucous quacking. This morning, the duck was clearly looking for a nest site, traversing in and out of borders, poking about under shrubs and retracing her waddling steps several times. Thanks to staying at the window, I witnessed the moment she chose her spot behind a rose bush and among the spring vibrancy of Bowles’s golden grass. With a few strong thrusts of her orange feet she formed a bowl, tossing aside snowdrop bulbs and yellow aconite seedlings, one deep enough to nestle in so her brown camouflaged back was level with the flower bed. It took just five minutes before she began collecting material to line it. Working steadily through emergent greenery, she deftly picked out last year’s blown leaves. Raffia-like grasses, fragments of hollyhock stem and irises, all teased out surprisingly nimbly by her flat paddle of a beak. Picked up, then rejected, the soggy shrivelled fruits of Japanese quince. Gradually her nest became lined with a duvet of dry lamb’s ears, their furry surface soft and downy. Hunkering down, her wing flash of electric blue no longer visible, she melded into the border. Being so close to the river, there’s usually a mallard nest somewhere in our garden. One year it was under a thatched roof of golden oats grass, another tucked back beneath a cotoneaster. Last summer, a duck, possibly the same one, nested in a spongy mass of thyme and I’d pass close by when I was in the veg garden. Once on eggs, females are reluctant to move – it was in this same border that a woodcock nested – despite being just feet away from my window. The mallard has laid an egg at every sunrise for 10 days now. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount", "section": "Environment", "query": "Nestle", "companies": ["Nestle"]}

A few weeks back I stayed in a treehouse where the bath, kitchen, dining table and seating area were all exposed to the elements. It was magical ... and impractical: my food got cold very quickly. Still, my garden designer pals tell me they are awash with requests for outdoor kitchens. And who wouldn’t enjoy an alfresco pizza oven? It used to be typically British to endure a picnic by an A-road in a jumper. Now we wait for dough to char while lounging on an Ikea Skålboda armchair, wearing Uniqlo ultra light down. But before you get to cooking outdoors, you need somewhere to sit. Garden furniture has long been one of my bugbears: the choices are so limited that I prefer to plump for vintage or use hard-wearing indoor furniture outside. Travertine tables, for instance, will put up with all weathers, so you don’t need to put them away at the end of summer. Check out Facebook Marketplace to look for a bargain. Wooden furniture that has been pressure-treated is far more resistant to rot, so vintage finds will need to be weather-proofed with oil or paint at least every two years. Plastic furniture – I’m thinking of all that fake rattan that has exploded into gardens in recent years – is hardier, but will benefit from a sponging down before the season starts. If you’ve been lured in by those Instagram photographs of cosy outdoor scenes dressed with rugs and blankets and cushions, know that you’ll need somewhere to stash those textiles at the end of the day: only the rugs made of recycled plastic will avoid mildew if left to face the dew and rain. Any garden furniture will look stark without some good planting to nestle it into the garden. Big wafty things – whether in the ground, growing up trellises or in pots – will soften hard edges and play nicely with the light. I chose a pressure-treated wooden arbour from Forest Garden for my garden, and have been training roses and jasmine over it. I’m also enjoying the interplay of Phlomis russeliana, Calamagrostis x acutiflora “Karl Foerster” and old-reliable fennel at the moment. All of these are pot-friendly and muddle along happily in my gravel-covered space. For an easy budget solution, a mass of thyme and oregano in containers will smell heavenly as well as being right there when you need a cocktail garnish. It’s worth remembering that even in the best years, the summer garden has to be packed away: solar lanterns, jumbo tongs and whatever is trending on TikTok all have to be stored in the colder months. Plants, meanwhile, have a convenient habit of dying back, going underground or staying politely where you put them.

They are intensely savoury, umami-rich and a vibrant, golden colour, much like bottarga, or Italian-style cured fish roe. Once dried, they take on a firm, grateable consistency, and are ideal for giving dishes a final punch of flavour – I often use them instead of cheese: try grating over pasta, risotto or steamed greens. Salt-cured egg yolks Salt-cured egg yolks are a fine project that I’ve been meaning to take on for a while. These golden orbs of deliciousness add an incredible burst of flavour to any dish that could benefit from a whack of umami. Grate over buttery pasta, risotto, sushi maki rolls or steamed greens for an extra hit of depth. I recently enjoyed mine over purple sprouting broccoli, where it melted into the warm florets like a golden seasoning, adding both colour and loads of flavour. The salting draws out moisture, so preserving the yolks and intensifying their taste. Some recipes include sugar for balance, or black pepper and herbs for extra flavour, but I prefer a basic salt cure. The leftover salt absorbs some of that richness, too – keep it in the fridge and use up as a seasoning within a couple of days – I like it for salting the water when I’m boiling greens or pasta. Egg yolks 2 tbsp fine sea salt per yolk Oil, for greasing Choose a dish or bowl that’s large enough to hold the number of yolks you’d like to cure in a single layer, and leaving at least 2cm between each yolk. Measure out two tablespoons of fine sea salt per egg yolk. Spread half the salt in the base of the dish, and make slight hollows in it to welcome the yolks. Carefully separate the eggs, keeping the yolks intact, then nestle the yolks in the salt hollows (save the whites in a clean container for another use – they’ll keep in the fridge for up to three days). Cover the yolks completely with the rest of the salt, then cover and refrigerate for four to five days, or until the yolks are firm to the touch. Lift the yolks one by one from the salt, brush off any excess, then rinse quickly under the cold tap and pat dry. At this stage, the yolks will be jelly-like, and are delicious sliced. To dry them further, so they can be grated, use the residual heat from the oven after baking or roasting. Lay the dried yolks on a lightly greased oven grate, then put in the hot oven and leave to dry for one to two hours, until firm and grateable; if you’re turning on the oven specifically for the yolks, set it to 90C (70C fan)/gas ¼.

But the document – a proposed mandate for the next Republican president authored by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank – also outlines steps that would radically transform food and farming, curtailing recent progress to address the excess of ultra-processed foods in the United States. Among those: weakening the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), ending policies that consider the effects of climate change – and eliminating the US dietary guidelines. “This is a deregulatory agenda,” said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food policy at New York University. “And what we know historically from deregulation is that it’s really bad for consumers, it’s bad for workers, it’s bad for the environment.” Project 2025 proposes changes to the country’s food assistance programs, like Snap and the Women, Infants and Children supplemental nutrition program (Wic), that Nestle believes are intended to dismantle such programs. It also calls for ending support for school meals. But one of the most notable of its proposals is calling on the next Republican president to eliminate or reform the dietary guidelines. Those guidelines form the basis for all federal food policies, from school meals to Snap, Wic and other programs. “There is no shortage of private-sector dietary advice for the public, and nutrition and dietary choices are best left to individuals to address their personal needs,” the document reads. The food industry has long pushed the idea that chronic, diet-related health conditions, like diabetes and obesity, are the result of individual choices – like not exercising enough. Today, nearly 42% of adults in the US are obese and about 12% have diabetes. But nutritionists emphasize that those conditions are not the result of a moral failing, but rather conditions caused by the ingredients and policies (like aggressively advertising to children) pushed by food companies. Nestle sees that as one of many pro-business policies outlined in Project 2025’s agricultural provisions that trusts companies to prioritize public health over profit. “There’s twice as many calories available in the food supply as the country needs on average. So the food industry is enormously competitive in selling calories,” she said. “Republicans want to deregulate, and give those food businesses every opportunity to make as much money as they possibly can, regardless of the effects on health and the environment.” Experts also fear the way Project 2025 could undermine the work being done by the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture to limit the flow of ultra-processed foods in the US food supply. Today, ultra-processed foods make up 73% of the US food supply, according to Northeastern University, and provide the average US adult with more than 60% of their daily calories. While the science is still emerging, researchers are increasingly linking UPFs to a range of health conditions including diabetes, obesity, depression and certain cancers. At the FDA, work is currently under way to develop a front-of-package label that corporations would be required to print on the fronts of products indicating when an item is high in sugar, fats, sodium or calories (the exact label has not yet been made public). Although the label wouldn’t specifically indicate when a food is ultra-processed, it would likely apply to a high percentage of UPFs in the food system because many contain large quantities of those nutrients. And at the USDA, members of the US dietary guidelines advisory committee are currently meeting and will give their recommendations for the 2025-30 dietary guidelines later this year. As it considers the advice it will issue to the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, the committee has been tasked with also evaluating research related to UPFs. It’s unclear what they’ll recommend - and whether that advice will make it into the 2025 dietary guidelines - but it’s a significant development for the committee to even consider ultra processing. But while Project 2025 makes no specific references to front-of-package nutritional labels like those currently under consideration at the FDA, Lindsey Smith Taillie, a professor of nutrition and co-director of the Global Food Research Program at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, says that eliminating the dietary guidelines will inevitably affect those. “It’s almost like they’re removing scientific evidence from federal food policy,” she said. Even if Trump isn’t elected next month, Philip Kahn-Pauli, director of legislative affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says he is “already seeing the impact of the policy proposals in Project 2025 in Congress today”. While approving funding for government agencies in 2025, the Republican-controlled House considered a bill that would “fundamentally change” the dietary guidelines process, he said in an emailed statement. The budgetary bill would have, among other things, nullified the currently in-process 2025 dietary guidelines. Although that bill was abandoned in favor of a continuing resolution to fund the government, Kahn-Pauli said, “the fact that there was such a partisan attack” on the dietary guidelines “signals a new focus on undercutting evidence-based policy”. He expects to see more attacks on the guidelines in the new year. Across the food system, Nestle says, Project 2025 would promote industry over climate, public health or welfare concerns: “The basic principle here is: don’t do anything that’s going to reduce industry profits.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Nestle", "companies": ["Nestle"]}

The classic homity pie filling of potatoes, onions and cream works beautifully with a jumble of cheese ends – cheddar, stilton, taleggio or whatever pungent blocks and rinds are lurking in your fridge drawer; it’s also a fantastic base for using up other root vegetables besides potatoes – celeriac, for example, bring earthiness, beetroot turns the entire filling a vibrant purple, while salsify adds a nutty note. Use whatever you have to hand, and waste nothing. Homity pie with cheese ends and seasonal roots This is a long-time family favourite. Mum used to make it for me as a kid and now I make it for my own children. This is an updated version of a recipe from my first book, The Natural Cook, specifically designed both to use up cheese ends and to be more flexible. Whether you’re using a mixture of potatoes and celeriac or experimenting with beetroot for a striking purple pie, this makes a a very sating, rich and flavourful meal that would also work as a centrepiece. Serve warm with a crisp green salad, dressed with a sharp dressing to cut through all that rich cheese. Serves 6 For the pastry case 200g wholemeal flour (spelt for preference), plus extra for dusting A pinch of sea salt 100g cold diced butter 1 egg, lightly beaten For the filling 500g new potatoes, or other root vegetables (carrots, celeriac, parsnips, beetroot, say), scrubbed clean, if need be 1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced 2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped A few thyme leaves (optional) 2 leeks, dark green tops only, thinly sliced, or 1 whole leek, thinly sliced 2 tbsp olive oil 4 sprigs parsley, roughly chopped from stem to leaf 150ml double cream 200g mixed cheese ends (cheddar, stilton, taleggio), grated or chopped Sea salt and cracked black pepper Olive oil Mix the flour and salt in a blender or large bowl, add the butter and work the mix until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Mix in the egg and just enough cold water (you’ll probably need between three and five tablespoons) to bring everything together into a firm dough, then cover and chill for half an hour. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and use it to line a high-sided tart tin or pie dish, gently pressing the pastry into the corners and letting it overhang all around the edge. Prick the base all over with a fork, chill for another 10 minutes, then blind bake on a tray at 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½, until the tart case starts to turn golden. Take out of the oven and trim the edges neatly with a bread knife (the trimmings make an excellent snack, incidentally). Meanwhile, chop the root veg into chunks, then boil them in salted water until tender. Drain and leave to steam dry. While the roots are cooking, gently saute the onion, garlic, thyme and leeks in the olive oil until soft and caramelised. Stir in the drained roots, parsley and cream, season generously, then pile into the pastry case. Scatter over the grated cheese and nestle any chunks of soft cheese in and around the vegetables – the filling should be heaped and rustic-looking. Return to the oven and bake until the top is bubbling and golden, with the odd charred patch here and there.

Indeed, so good is it that, though the dish is native to the southern region of Casamance, it’s popular on menus as far afield as neighbouring Gambia. If poulet yassa is new to you, however, you have a real treat in store: a braised dish of chicken marinated in sweet onions, tangy citrus and warm chilli, it tastes, as Lerato Umah-Shaylor puts it so beautifully, like “sunshine on a plate” – and certainly, as my parents observed when I introduced them to it, far more than the sum of its parts. Simple ingredients, complex flavours – and a guaranteed crowdpleaser. The meat Alexa Weibel, who adapted chef Pierre Thiam’s recipe from The Fonio Cookbook for the New York Times, says that though Thiam uses chicken legs, “in southern Senegal, where the dish originated, you might be served other chicken parts, fish yassa or even lamb yassa”. Legs are the most popular cut, with Umah-Shaylor also suggesting thighs in her book Africana, though both Gabonese chef and food writer Anto Cocagne and food historian and author Jessica B Harris start with whole birds, and joint them. I think the juiciness of legs makes them the superior choice, but go with whatever you prefer, leaving the skin on and the bones in, ideally – the skin will help keep the flesh moist and render fat into the sauce, while the bones provide flavour. (Note that, if you don’t eat meat, this sauce also works well with tofu or roast squash.) The marinade The common factor here is citrus juice, be that lemon or lime, though I prefer the richer, fruitier tang of the latter. Cocagne and Umah-Shaylor put in the zest as well, a nice idea that I’m going to save for the sauce, because I don’t think the flavour really transfers to the chicken while it’s marinating. Most recipes also add chopped or pureed onion (though Thiam and Dakar-born Khadim Mbamba, the chef behind London’s Little Baobab, both prefer the green spring onion variety). Other possible additions include thyme, bay and parsley, none of which my testers and I can really pick up in the meat – like the citrus zest, then, such aromatics are also better deployed later in the process, as are Mbamba and Cocagne’s ginger and mustard. The latter makes a Senegalese red pepper paste, nokoss, to go in the marinade, which as well as the ingredients already mentioned features chilli, red onion, tomato, celery and soumbala powder, which is made from the fermented seeds of the néré, or African locust bean tree. I suspect peppers and tomatoes in the UK are more watery and less intensely flavoured than those in Senegal, because my version turns out noticeably paler and more liquid than the one in the photograph, and sadly doesn’t add much flavour when deployed in such a small quantity. Mbamba’s green pepper version is far punchier, but I’ve elected to keep things very simple indeed and stick to salt, citrus and onion, and the same ingredients that flavour the sauce. Rather than adding all the onions to the marinade, as many recipes suggest, I’ve kept most of them back to speed up the browning process when it comes to making the sauce. The cooking Weibel explains that “the cooking method is flexible: the chicken develops the best smoky char when grilled, but will still be delicious seared in a grill pan or cast-iron skillet”. The consensus online seems to be that while yassa traditionally involves barbecued meat, these days home cooks are more likely to fry it indoors, though you could roast it, too, as Mbamba recommends, with similarly delicious results. Indeed, roasting or using a grill pan are both great options, as is Umah-Shaylor’s overhead grill, but I’ve chosen to fry them, as recommended by Cocagne’s book Saka Saka and Amethyst Ganaway’s recipe for Serious Eats, to render as much fat, and therefore flavour, as possible from the skins for use in the sauce. (My only caveat with roasting the meat is that it doesn’t leave the chicken quite as juicy as frying, grilling, or griddling to colour, before braising it with the sauce. Whichever method you choose, pour any fat or juice that’s escaped the chicken into the sauce when you add the meat to it.) The sauce Onions and citrus, with a backbone of chilli heat, are the building blocks here – pretty much everything else is an optional extra – so it’s essential to take the time to brown the onions properly, so they offer a caramelised contrast to the tangy juice. My testers and I also really like the sweetness Harris’ that carrots bring to proceeding (though you may prefer to use red pepper or Thiam’s green version, though they will, of course, be less sweet), as well as the saltiness of the olives that she and Mbamba both pop in. Olives and dijon mustard, the probable legacy of three centuries of colonial occupation by France, are not obligatory, but the flavours do work really well. Orléans-based caterer Mamy Coco told food blogger and author Bernard Laurance in 2014 that in her native Casamance, poulet yassa tends to be less citrussy and mustardy than the versions now found in places such as Dakar, concluding that it was thus “for you to judge the level of acidity that best pleases your tastebuds”. I’d echo this, while urging you not to be too shy; this recipe sings at full volume. We love the almost marmalade-like flavour that the lemon zest gives Cocagne’s dish, and the complementary warmth of thyme and ginger with the obligatory chilli. Which variety you use, and in what quantity, depends similarly on the pleasure capsaicin brings your tastebuds. I like the fruitiness of scotch bonnet, pricked so it gently infuses the sauce with its heat (and can be whipped out when it hits your specific sweet hotspot), but any red chilli will do, depending on availability and preference. If you’re not keen on chilli heat, use a milder variety and go big on black pepper instead – Thiam adds two whole teaspoons of the stuff to his version. If you’ve barbecued or roasted the chicken, you might want to dilute the sauce with chicken stock, as Umah-Shaylor and Ganaway recommend, but if you’ve fried it, it should be rich enough without. (That said, though none of the recipes I try calls for it, a dash of Maggi seasoning is a common addition, so a pinch of MSG wouldn’t go amiss, if you feel so moved.) To eat Rice is the most common serving suggestion, but couscous is mentioned by Ganaway, “creamy mashed potatoes and green beans” by Umah-Shaylor and fluffy, nutty fonio, an ancient variety of millet that’s a staple in West Africa, by almost everyone else. Erica Turner tells readers of America’s Test Kitchen that “braised hibiscus leaves (widely eaten in Senegal) are a traditional accompaniment, but cooked spinach seasoned with lemon juice is a fine alternative”. Perfect chicken yassa This can be made ahead of time, because it reheats very well indeed. Prep 20 min Marinate 4 hr+ Cook 55 min Serves 4 2 lemons, or 3 limes Fine salt and black pepper 4 skin-on and bone-in chicken legs 4 medium onions 2 tbsp groundnut oil, or other neutral oil 2 carrots, thinly sliced at an angle, or 1 red pepper, thinly sliced 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger 1 tbsp thyme leaves, or 1 tsp dried thyme 1 tbsp dijon mustard 1 scotch bonnet, or other warm red chilli pepper 80g green olives Finely grate the zest of half the citrus fruit, set the zest aside, then juice all the fruit into a bowl and stir in a teaspoon of salt. Cut a few deep slashes in the skin side of the chicken, then put it in a suitable container with the lime juice mixture and rub it in well. Finely slice one of the onions, add this to the container and mix again, then cover and refrigerate for four to eight hours. Put the oil in a large frying pan for which you have a lid, then set it over a medium-high flame. Lift the chicken from its marinade (don’t throw the marinade away), pat it dry, then fry, in batches if necessary, just until well browned on all sides. Thinly slice the remaining onions (I use a mandoline). Set aside the chicken and turn down the heat under the pan slightly. Add the sliced onions, season, and leave to cook undisturbed for four minutes, or until they’re beginning to brown. Stir, then cook, stirring regularly, for 12-15 minutes, until the onions are soft and golden. Add the onions from the marinade (save the citrussy liquid), then stir in the carrots, ginger, thyme and grated zest, and cook for another couple of minutes. Stir in the mustard, marinade liquid and 125ml water, then nestle the chicken pieces into the the onion mix. Add the chilli and olives, and bring to a simmer. Cover, turn down the heat and leave to braise for 30-40 minutes, until the meat is cooked through; lift out and discard the chilli halfway through, unless you like it hot. Check the seasoning, adjust if necessary, then serve with rice, fonio, millet or couscous. Poulet yassa: what’s the secret to greatness?

It was a sensational weekend lunch. Today’s tender and light dumplings are just so – peas and onions make the sauce, but plentiful olive oil and butter, plus some generous seasoning, take them to another level. The pudding is a tiramisu of sorts, and all the better for it: blissfully easy to pull together and indecently delicious. Ricotta dumplings with butter-braised peas and mint (pictured top) The peas melt into the fat but with enough white wine and lemon juice to pique your interest. Then the tender, light ricotta dumplings are fried golden and nestle in the vegetables. Bliss.

Put it in a sieve, then lay four sheets of kitchen paper on top of each other on a plate. Tip the ricotta on to the paper and top with four more sheets. Press the ricotta into a ball, squeezing out as much moisture as you can. Once the sheets are soaked through, discard and repeat with four more sheets, continuing until the ricotta is dry and crumbly. Put the ricotta in a food processor with the grated cheese, whole egg and egg yolk, a teaspoon of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper, then pulse/blitz until everything just comes together. Sprinkle in the flour, pulse again to combine, then transfer the dough to a large bowl and put in the freezer to set. Put the oil and the halved garlic in a deep saute pan on a medium-high heat. Season the lettuce, then brown it in the garlic oil for a few minutes on each side, until coloured. Lift out the lettuce, then add 40g butter to the pan. Once it’s melted, add the onions, season generously and cook, stirring often, over a medium heat for about 20 minutes, until translucent and soft. Meanwhile, dust a large tray with flour. Take the ricotta mix out of the freezer and, using two tablespoons to shape them, scoop out oblong quenelles and transfer to the tray. Set aside somewhere cool. Add the crushed garlic to the onions, fry for a few minutes, then shred the sauteed lettuce and add that, too. Finally, stir in peas, wine and stock, and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, until the peas are cooked but still bursting in the mouth, then add the lemon juice and mint, then taste to check the seasoning. Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and cook the dumplings in batches for three to four minutes, until they are cooked through, firm and float to the top of the water. With a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked dumplings to a plate lined with kitchen towel while you cook the remaining dumplings. Melt the remaining 30g butter in a frying pan on a high heat, then saute the poached dumplings for three to four minutes on each side, until golden. Serve the dumplings nestled in the buttered peas, scattered with more grated cheese and a few glugs of oil. Rhubarb, cardamom and mascarpone trifle Whipped cream and cardamom is my idea of heaven.

A glance at the Scottish Premiership table – Celtic still lead their old adversaries by 11 points and 20-odd goals – suggests Brendan Rodgers and his players can achieve that. It is simply that the scale of Celtic’s ineptitude in this 3-0 defeat had to be seen to be believed. Not one element of their team functioned properly. Rangers opened 2025 in swashbuckling style against rattled, ragged opposition. This was a puzzling afternoon for Celtic, one that is bound to trigger speculation about complacency with the title all but guaranteed. To his credit Rodgers did nothing to sugarcoat his side’s display. The Celtic manager told his players at half-time they surely could not be as poor in the second 45 minutes. If the visitors did improve it was only marginally. In his two spells and over 21 derbies, this was by far the poorest account a Rodgers team has given against Rangers. “It wouldn’t matter if we were 50 points clear,” he said. “Celtic-Rangers is everything for our supporters, for people everywhere. But we never played with that edge and that personality that the team has shown consistently. We were just very passive, I felt, today, which is unlike us. We were punished for that.” Rodgers had planned to start his record signing, Arne Engels, in midfield. The Belgian was unwell on Thursday and had to settle for a place on the bench. While that can be categorised as bad fortune, other elements of Celtic’s output were by design. It was curious, for example, that Rodgers opted not to deploy the physicality of Adam Idah from the start against a makeshift Rangers defence. Liam Kelly, the hosts’ goalkeeper, was not tested until first-half stoppage time. Leaving Auston Trusty out, with Liam Scales partnering Cameron Carter-Vickers in central defence, was equally questionable. Trusty was a £6m summer purchase surely for performing on stages such as this. It felt strange that it took 64 minutes for Rodgers to turn to his substitutes. No sooner had he done so than Robin Pröpper slammed home Rangers’ second goal. Game over. Even before illness Engels, Trusty and Idah have not played nearly as regularly as their combined price tags suggest they should have done. Rangers will understandably rail against intense focus on Celtic. This was a much-needed, marquee moment for Philippe Clement. The low-key atmosphere around Ibrox before kick-off told a story of nervous fans, fearing another damaging afternoon. Rangers had a left-back playing at right-back, for heaven’s sake. Instead, Clement has secured a maiden derby victory. He did so in such comfortable fashion it was surely beyond his wildest new year dreams. In front of his famous father, Gheorghe, Ianis Hagi set the tone. The midfielder’s finish was accurate rather than powerful after a lay-off from Nico Raskin. Kasper Schmeichel watched the ball nestle in his net after Scales had conceded possession cheaply. Raskin was to enjoy an outstanding afternoon in blue. When a deflected Vaclav Cerny shot hit the crossbar Celtic were rocking. Carter-Vickers produced a goal-saving challenge on Mohamed Diomande. Celtic needed half-time for a reset that never materialised. Watching this, Rodgers’ desire to return Kieran Tierney to green and white became easy to understand. Raskin snapped and snarled as Celtic’s midfield was overrun. Nedim Bajrami excelled at finding pockets of space for Rangers in attacking areas. Cerny came even closer to No 2, his effort rebounding from the inside of Schmeichel’s far post. Celtic failed to heed the warning, Raskin’s header from a Cerny corner blocked before the much maligned Pröpper found the net. Rodgers had called for Idah merely 120 seconds earlier. There was no sign of Celtic making Rangers sweat for their win. Indeed, gloss was added to the scoreline for Clement as Danilo pounced on a loose ball for the third. At this point, Rangers’ supporters were surely bemoaning the absence of a Celtic following inside their stadium. There was, after all, nobody to gloat at. “I knew in June that this was a really, really big challenge,” said Clement. “I do it because I love this club so much – the fans and everybody in the building. This is a massive club but we’re not yet where we want to be. I want to be part of that, to get this club back to the level it needs to be.” Clement’s challenge is to avoid the one step forward, two steps back theme of recent times. Rodgers must decipher how on earth this first domestic defeat of the season happened. His professional pride will ensure he never wants it to happen again.", "section": "Football", "query": "Nestle", "companies": ["Nestle"]}

Are Americans ready to let go?", "date": null, "author": "Aimee Levitt", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "The Make America Healthy Again (Maha) movement celebrated this month after the US dairy industry voluntarily pledged to remove all artificial dyes from ice-cream by 2028. In April, US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr prevailed upon the food industry to stop using artificial dyes, and many of the nation’s largest food manufacturers, including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo, have already promised to comply. But the ice-cream pledge made Kennedy especially happy because, he said, ice-cream is his favorite food. Prepare to say goodbye to the brilliant pink (from red dye No 40) that signifies strawberry, the cool green (yellow 5 and blue 1) of mint chocolate chip, and the heroic combination of red 40, blue 1, and yellow 5 and 6 that makes up Superman. One of the goals of the Maha movement is to prevent childhood diseases, which Kennedy argues can be accomplished by, among other things, addressing the use of additives in ultra-processed foods. A recent study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics calculated that, in 2020, 19% of food products contained artificial dyes – “the most egregious” additive, according to Kennedy. Those dyes, he claims, are responsible for a host of health issues, including cancer, hyperactivity and possibly autism. “The American people have made it clear – they want real food, not chemicals,” Kennedy said in a statement. Aside from jokes on social media about Donald Trump’s skin tone and Kennedy’s alleged use of methylene blue (an artificial dye that some claim boosts “mitochondrial efficiency” and longevity), the initiative has faced little political opposition. In January, when Joe Biden was still president, the FDA announced a ban on red dye No 3 scheduled to go into effect in 2027. Red 3, the FDA explained, was shown to cause cancer in rats, and while it does not show up in food in large enough quantities to affect humans, it still violates a law forbidding additives that contain carcinogens. Meanwhile, states as politically varied as West Virginia, Texas and California have already established their own bans or requirements that foods containing artificial dyes carry warning labels, citing the need to protect kids. (In the UK and the EU, restrictions on artificial dyes have been in place for years.) Why the fuss over food coloring? Are natural dyes really that much better for our health? “They’re better for some people’s health,” says Jamie Alan, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University. “There is a very small percentage of children who are very sensitive to these dyes. And when they eat these dyes, they display behaviors that we sometimes associate with ADHD.” Alan stresses that there is no evidence that those kids actually develop ADHD. But research has found that after eating foods containing certain dyes, children, including those diagnosed with ADHD or autism, can show signs of hyperactivity, moodiness and inattentiveness. However many of these foods, particularly candy and soda, also contain sugar, which has also been connected to hyperactive behavior. Alan recommends that parents talk to a pediatrician and try an elimination diet to make sure the dye and not another ingredient is to blame. But she largely supports phasing out artificial dyes; most public health advocates think this is a good idea. “In my opinion,” Alan says, “because we’re talking about children and because they are a vulnerable population, I do think this is a great thing to do. But I will recognize that it is not going to impact the vast majority of the population.” One group that the change in dyes will certainly affect is the food manufacturers themselves. Switching from artificial to natural dyes is a complex process, says Travis Zissu, the co-founder and innovation lead of Scale Food Labs in Golden, Colorado, which offers a program to help manufacturers with the dye conversion. Unlike artificial dyes, which are derived from petroleum, natural dyes come mostly from plants: turmeric, for example, is used for yellows; algae and butterfly pea flower for blues; lycopene from carrots and tomatoes for reds. These dyes can be less stable, so Scale’s program begins with finding natural pigments that will not be affected by heat and other chemicals, followed by tests to determine which combination of dyes will produce the most reliable color. Next, Scale helps companies lock in contracts that will not force them to raise their prices too much and secure light-sensitive packaging to protect the colors. Finally, there are nine to 12 months of product testing to make sure production runs smoothly and that there are no adverse effects for consumers, such as red-dyed feces (something that has been known to happen with beet powder and extract; Alan says it’s harmless, but admits it can be unnerving). But Zissu’s biggest concern is that there won’t be enough to go around. Natural color demand is already up between 30-50% across the industry since food companies began announcing their intentions to stop using artificial color, he says, and the earliest deadline – 2027 – is still years away. “There is simply not enough supply to replace every single item in the market,” he says. “You’ll see the largest companies locking down colors soon, but there will not be enough until 2030.” There is also the worry that American consumers will reject the new colors altogether. While their counterparts in Europe, Canada and Japan have peacefully accepted the duller hues of natural dyes, Americans remain stubbornly attached to neon-bright candy and cereal. Case in point: in 2015, General Mills pledged to remove all artificial colors and flavorings from its products. The following year, it rolled out a natural version of Trix, the kid-friendly fruity breakfast cereal. But the muted Trix, colored by radishes, purple carrots and turmeric, was a flop. Customers missed the vibrant colors and complained that the new version didn’t taste right. By 2017, “classic Trix” had returned to grocery stores. On the other hand, when Kraft reformulated the powder for its macaroni and cheese and quietly began selling the all-natural version in December 2015, there was much less protest. As an Eater headline at the time put it: “Kraft Changed Its Mac and Cheese and Nobody Noticed.” Perhaps it was the marketing strategy – Kraft did not bother to make a big announcement until after it had sold 50m boxes – or maybe it was because the natural dyes were just as orange as the original. (Alan recalls that her young nieces and nephews were slightly worried about the change but accepted the new mac and cheese without much fuss.) As the adage goes, we eat with our eyes. The appearance of food should not change our perceptions of how it tastes, but, as anyone who has ever bought produce knows, it definitely does. In nature, brighter colors indicate that foods are ripe and will taste good. This principle also applies to human-made food. As far back as the middle ages, according to Ai Hisano, a professor of business history at the University of Tokyo and author of Visualizing Taste: How Business Changed the Look of What You Eat, dairy farmers would mix carrot juice and annatto from achiote trees into their butter to make it a more appetizing yellow. When scientists discovered petroleum-based dyes in the mid-19th century, the dairy industry was one of the earliest adopters: the artificial dyes were cheaper, and they helped create uniform yellows for butter and cheese that appealed to shoppers. Other food producers quickly followed suit. Meat would be red! Sandwich bread would be white! Oranges – which sometimes stayed green, even when they were ripe – would be orange! By the early 20th century, the US government had started regulating food coloring to make sure it didn’t kill anyone. This was also the beginning of the golden age of industrial food such as candy, breakfast cereal and, most notoriously, Jell-O, which came in colors never seen in nature. Food dye became vital for branding, Hisano writes. Even if brighter color didn’t really affect flavor because the food was entirely manufactured, people perceived that it did, and that was what mattered. Would a beige Flamin’ Hot Cheeto taste as spicy? “I assume many consumers in the early 20th century were frightened by those bright-red foods,” Hisano told the Atlantic in 2017. “But one reason consumers liked them is because they were excited about these colors they had never seen before.” And the knowledge that they were regulated by the FDA made them feel they were safe to eat. Because the identity of their products depends on color, the most resistance to Kennedy’s initiative has come from America’s candy manufacturers. A spokesman for the National Confectioners Association said that candy makers will not adopt natural dyes until federal regulations compel them to. Of all the biggest US food companies, only Mars, maker of M&amp;Ms, Skittles and Starburst (incidentally, Trump’s favorite candy), has not yet pledged to give up artificial dye, except for the already banned red 3. However, FDA commissioner Marty Makary told Fox News that he thinks Mars will come around sooner than later. (*See footnote). Zissu, the food dye consultant, foresees “an R&amp;D sprint” to develop natural dyes before the 2027 deadline. And indeed, since May, the FDA has approved four new natural colors – three blues and one white – for a wide range of food, including juices, milk-based meal replacements, cereal, chips, sugar and ready-to-eat chicken products. But Zissu does not think that a transition to natural dyes means that the color of food will revert to a pre-industrial dullness. “I believe we will always see the bright colors in candy and other items that consumers come to expect,” he says. “There will just be a lot more research dedicated to getting those colors if artificial [dye] is banned.” It may also help if America’s food manufacturers act en masse, as they appear to be doing: the change will be so overwhelming that, as Zissu puts it, “neon synthetics will look as dated as trans fats.” Perhaps in a few years, we will look back at green mint chip ice-cream in wonder. (Some people already do: many ice-cream producers, including Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Häagen-Dazs, don’t use green as the signifier for mint.) It seems Maha is poised to help shake America of its affair with artificial colors. But it celebrates this victory at the same time as the Trump administration guts public health infrastructure. The ice-cream industry’s pledge came just 11 days after Congress passed a spending bill that will cut Medicaid spending, and therefore healthcare for millions of children, and slash Snap food assistance for US families. It came the same day that the Department of Health laid off thousands of employees. Under Trump, the government has also cut research grants to scientists studying, among other things, disease prevention and vaccines (of which Kennedy is a notorious skeptic). Underlying issues such as food and housing insecurity and child poverty that devastate children’s wellbeing are likely to worsen. Alan thinks that if Kennedy is serious about improving the health of America’s kids, there are much more pressing issues than food dye to work on. “I just can’t believe that someone would be given a chance to make such an impact,” she says, “and this is what they choose to do.” • Footnote added on 18 August 2025: Representatives on behalf of Mars contacted us after publication to say that on 24 July 2025 the company announced they would offer choice products made without FD&amp;C colors in 2026, including M&amp;Ms, Skittles and Starburst.", "section": "Business", "query": "Nestle", "companies": ["Nestle"]}

Sure, slicing and grilling halloumi to top salads or nestle inside a breakfast sandwich is always going to be a good idea, but there’s so much more you can do with your slab. “I like to criss-cross one side of the halloumi, rub it with olive oil and seasoning, put it in a snug dish and pop it under a medium grill for eight minutes,” says Georgina Hayden, author of Greekish. That’s an excellent strategy when faced with a larger piece – as a veggie main at a barbecue, for example – but you could, of course, grill it in slices, too. “For the best flavour, pop it on the barbecue,” Hayden adds. “On a warm day, there’s nothing better than finely sliced good-quality halloumi with watermelon.” Another thrill from the grill is Jorge Paredes’ caesar salad, for which he swaps chicken for halloumi. The head chef of Oma in London makes the dressing as normal, “mixing anchovies, parmesan, olive oil, mustard, and salt and pepper”. He then grills the halloumi and adds it to baby gem lettuce before tossing with the dressing. “I also make rosemary croutons for crunch.” Another use for the cheese that refuses to melt is keftedes, a type of Greek fritter. In her version, Hayden salts grated courgettes and sets them aside while she combines flour, baking powder, breadcrumbs and black pepper. Give the courgettes a good squeeze to get rid of the excess water, then add them to the flour bowl with sliced spring onions, chopped mint and grated halloumi. Finally, mix in beaten egg, then fry heaped tablespoons of the mix in batches for four minutes per side. Röstis are another good ideas; in her book Tucking In, Sophie Wyburd combines grated halloumi with the potato, which “helps them get so crispy and golden, not to mention perfectly seasoned”. Alternatively, try mixing grated halloumi into pie fillings, or meatballs, which Nigel Slater does with minced pork, spring onion, garlic, chilli and dried mint. Parades, meanwhile, might soak slices of halloumi in milk overnight, “to get rid of the saltiness”, then dusts them with flour and panko breadcrumbs. “Deep fry and serve with aïoli as a snack or starter.” For a more hands-off approach, though, put your trust in a traybake. A favourite is Anna Jones’ ras el hanout roasted chickpeas with broccoli and halloumi, in which drained tinned chickpeas are mixed with ras el hanout, orange zest and juice, olive oil and seasoning, and roasted for 10 minutes. Score the top of halloumi (much as Hayden does above), pop that on the tray with broccoli and pumpkin seeds, and give everything a good toss. Return to the oven for 10 minutes, then serve with a dressing of tahini, orange juice and olive oil. That all said, the ultimate cheese pleaser has to be halloumi “croutons”. In The Green Cookbook, Rukmini Iyer bakes cubes of the cheese in a 220C (200C fan) oven until golden, then sprinkles them over tagines. You’ll want to keep some of those to hand for topping soups and salads, too. Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian", "section": "Food", "query": "Nestle", "companies": ["Nestle"]}

Thus far, the Australian quartet have dealt in a brand of punk that carries with it the distinct whiff of the pub and the roughhouse pop-cultural heritage of their homeland. (There’s definitely something of the sharpie, a peculiarly Antipodean youth cult/folk devil, about their haircuts.) Blessed with songs called Blowjobs, Gacked on Anger and Don’t Need a Cunt (Like You to Love Me), their oeuvre has treated the concept of subtlety in much the same way as most people treat spam emails promising immediate bitcoin windfalls or sexual congress with lonely Russian beauties: just ignore it and move swiftly on, no good will come of engaging. They are very good at what they do. Singer Amy Taylor sounds like X-Ray Spex’s Poly Styrene might have had she hailed from Bundoora or Wonga Park, and the band are on the brink of transforming critical acclaim and cult status into something much bigger. For their forthcoming UK tour, they have sold out three nights at London’s Roundhouse and added a fourth at the 10,000-capacity Alexandra Palace. Cartoon Darkness initially presents itself as business as usual. The front cover features a blurred photo of Taylor flashing her breasts while sticking her tongue out, the rest of the Sniffers looking, as ever, like a stylist’s nightmare of mullets and sliders teamed with white socks. Opener Jerkin’ rages along for two minutes on a fabulously primitive one-chord riff, starts with the lyrics “You’re an arsehole”, and comes with a video featuring so many unclothed genitals – some of them being quite vigorously manipulated, as per the song’s title – that you can only see it on the band’s website after confirming you’re over 18. Yet underneath the brash surface of Jerkin’, it’s clear that something, or rather some things, have changed as a result of their burgeoning success. The lyrics prickle at criticism, throwing the band’s fame at their “loser” detractors in the manner of a rapper. And with its litany of slang terms for Australian places – “Brizzie”, “Tassie” – the similarly themed U Should Not Be Doing That takes aim at self-appointed punk gatekeepers and sexists. Do It Do It, meanwhile, chucks more bile in the direction of “another person saying I’m not doing it right”, but equally seems nervous about the pitfalls of mainstream success: “When you get to the mountaintop will you put all the snow up your nose?” And on Tiny Bikini, Taylor appears to be oddly conflicted about her onstage image, or at least concerned about it being misconstrued. “I know it’s technically my space, but I’m the only one here in a bikini,” she sings, before pondering what would happen “if I didn’t show up in something spicy”. Tiny Bikini sets a deliberately cartoonish baby-doll vocal to a fantastic take-the-rest-of-the-week-off riff and pummelling drums, the band’s trademark sound sharpened by veteran producer Nick Launay. But the most striking tracks on Cartoon Darkness suggest a group aware of their self-imposed musical limitations to date, and interested in seeing how far they can push the boundaries of what they do while still essentially sounding like Amyl and the Sniffers. Which brings us to the aforementioned acoustic guitar on Bailing on Me, a song that would once have been characterised as more new wave than punk, Taylor’s vocal notwithstanding. It is melodically strong – as is Big Dreams, a sombre reflection on failure built around a moody, arpeggiated guitar. Both tracks sound thoughtful, not an adjective anyone was going to use about the Amyl and the Sniffers of 2019’s GFY (initials which stood, with a certain inevitability, for Go Fuck Yourself). U Should Not Be Doing That picks up where their 2020 cover of Patrick Hernandez’s Born to Be Alive left off: disco drums and a guitar riff that sounds like a boozy cousin of New Order’s Ceremony. Clearly, none of these musical developments amount to breaking new ground, but they suggest a band alert to the danger of repeating themselves, and nestle among their tried-and-tested ragers rather than sounding grafted on. The lyrics about their success aren’t the whole story – there’s plenty of horror at the state of the world, as on Doing in Me Head, and ample evidence they still think throwing yourself into hedonism is a useful corrective. But these still feel like the most pertinent lyrics, simply because Cartoon Darkness might just be an album built to further their success. One way or another, they’ll have to come to terms with it, and the naysaying losers will have to lump it.

She surveyed the native grasses and flowering plants that painted the Central valley landscape in almost blinding swaths of yellow. Her objective on that sweltering spring day was to gather materials pivotal to California’s ambitious environmental agenda – seeds. “Over there it’s a brighter yellow, so I know those flowers are still blooming, rather than going to seed production,” she noted. “Versus over here, it’s these hues of deeper reds and deeper gold. That seed is ready.” As a seed collection manager with the non-profit Heritage Growers native seed supplier, Holgate is tasked with traveling to the state’s wildlands to collect native seeds crucial for habitat restoration projects. The need has become particularly acute as California aims to conserve 30% of its land by 2030, with the governor pledging to restore “degraded landscapes” and expand “nature-based solutions” to fight the climate crisis. And as the Trump administration systematically rolls back efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect public lands, the state’s goals have taken on even greater importance. But the rising demand for seeds far outpaces the available supply. California faces an “urgent and growing need” to coordinate efforts to increase the availability of native seeds, according to a 2023 report from the California Native Plant Society. There simply isn’t enough wildland seed available to restore the land at the rate the state has set out to, Holgate said. Bridging the gap starts with people like Holgate, who spends five days a week, eight months of the year, traveling with colleagues to remote spots across the state collecting seeds – an endeavor that could shape California’s landscape for years. That fact is not lost on the 26-year-old. It’s something she tries to remind her team during long, grueling, hot days in the oilfields of Kern county or the San Joaquin valley. “What we do is bigger than just the day that we live. The species that we collect are going to make impacts on the restoration industry for decades to come,” Holgate said. ••• Seeds play a vital role in landscape recovery. When fires move through forests, decimating native species and leaving the earth a charred sea of grey ash, or when farmlands come out of production, land managers use native seeds to help return the land to something closer to its original form. They have been an essential part of restoring the Klamath River after the largest dam removal project in US history, covering the banks of the ailing river in milkweeds that attract bees and other pollinators, and Lemmon’s needlegrass, which produces seeds that feed birds and small mammals. California has emphasized the importance of increasing native seed production to protect the state’s biodiversity, which one state report described as “the most imperiled … of any state in the contiguous United States”. Three-quarters of native vegetation in the state has been altered in the last 200 years, including more than 90% of California wetlands, much of them here in the Central valley. For the state to implement its plans, it needs a massive quantity of native seeds – far more than can be obtained in the wild. Enter Heritage Growers, the northern California-based non-profit founded by experts with the non-profit River Partners, which works to restore river corridors in the state and create wildlife habitat. The organization takes seed that Holgate and others collect and amplifies them at its Colusa farm, a 2,088-acre (845-hectare) property located an hour from the state capital. (The ethical harvesting rules Heritage Growers adhere to mean that they can take no more than 20% of seeds available the day of collection.) Workers dry the seeds collected in the wild over several weeks, clean them and send them off to a lab for testing. The farm cultivates them to grow additional seeds, in some cases slowly expanding from a small plot to a tenth of an acre, and eventually several acres. The process – from collection to amplification – can take years. Currently, the farm is producing more than 30,000lbs of seeds each year and has more than 200 native plant varieties. The goal, general manager Pat Reynolds said, is to produce source-identified native seed and get as much of it out in the environment as possible to restore habitat at scale. The group has worked with federal agencies such as the National Parks Service, state agencies and conservation organizations, and provided seed for River Partners’ restoration efforts of the land that will become California’s newest state park, Dos Rios. The benefit of restoring California’s wildlands extends far beyond the environment, said Austin Stevenot, a member of the Northern Sierra Mewuk Tribe and the director of tribal engagement for River Partners. “It’s more than just work on the landscape, because you’re restoring places where people have been removed and by inviting those people back in these places we can have cultural restoration,” Stevenot said. “Our languages, our cultures, are all tied to the landscape.” He pointed to Dos Rios, where there is a native-use garden within the park where Indigenous people can collect the plants they need for basketweaving. “It’s giving the space back to people to freely do what we would like for the landscape and for our culture,” he said. ••• Just three farms in California produce thousands of pounds of native seed each year, including Heritage Growers, Reynolds said, meaning that restoration efforts take significant long-term planning. In the case of the Klamath River project, it took at least five years of work – collecting the seed, cleaning it and amplifying it at multiple farms – to obtain the seed necessary to use for river restoration. But before Heritage Growers can amplify seed, Holgate has to gather materials in the wild. Holgate, a sunny and personable seed collector who studied environmental science and management with a focus in ecological restoration, has developed Heritage Growers’ program over the last two years. In late March, she headed out to scout the Arena plains area of the Merced national wildlife refuge, more than 10,200 acres of protected lands, including wetlands and vernal pools, in the San Joaquin valley. Her winter break had come to an end and collection season was kicking off again, meaning months of travel and logging upward of 1,000 miles (1,600km) a week as she and a group of wildland seed collectors visited dozens of sites across the valley and in the foothills. Collection days typically start when the sun rises, and stretch until it gets too hot to work. In recent weeks, Holgate’s team had planned their collection strategy and surveyed sites to see what plants were available. Getting to the Arena plains area required a 30-minute drive down a bumpy dirt road. In a large white pickup, she passed a large owl perched in a tree and navigated a narrow creekside lane. From her vehicle, Holgate often performs what she describes as “drive-by botany”, quickly scouting the land to see what’s available. She maneuvered through a herd of curious, but cautious, calves before trudging through thick mud and carefully slipping through barbed wire fencing to take in the scene. Equipped with a bucket, a sun hat and a backpack, Holgate was eager to observe the landscape, noting what was seeding and what needed more time. The work is simultaneously thrilling and sometimes tedious, Holgate said as she compared two plants that looked identical but were in fact different species. Seed collectors must be able to distinguish between species to ensure the materials they collect are genetically pure, she noted. The temperature climbed to 89F (32C) as she meandered across the plains, noting which species were available and how ripe the seeds were. Holgate monitored a herd of cattle approaching. When she began working in the area, Holgate viewed the creatures and the way they trampled through the vernal pools and chomped on the vegetation as a negative impact on the landscape, she said. But she later learned how grazing can benefit this ecosystem. The depressions cattle make as they move through the area allow seeds to nestle further into the ground, and their grazing reduces invasive grasses, allowing flowers to receive more sunlight and giving them space to bloom, Holgate noted. Chasing down seeds is a nomadic lifestyle in which one has to be OK with long stretches away from home, and an inordinate amount of prepared road food, like bacon and gouda sandwiches from Starbucks, Holgate said, pausing as a coyote and its pup ran through nearby flowers, winding through the cows and heading just out of sight. Along with travel to distant locations from the wildlife refuge to Kern county in the south, Holgate has to return any seeds collected to the Heritage Growers farm within 24 to 48 hours. But the mission is worthwhile, Holgate said. The seeds she collects are expensive, but if they can be amplified and expanded, native seeds will become more abundant and restoration projects can happen more quickly. “We can restore California faster,” she said. “It’s the only way we are going to be able to restore California at the rate we want to.” The seed collection team has 35 sites they will return to this season. Spending so many hours on the same swaths of land has allowed Holgate and her colleagues to know the areas on a far deeper level than they would if they were just hiking through. It’s left her with a familiarity she can’t shake – that dainty grass isn’t just grass, it’s hair grass; the lighter spots are Hordeum depressum, a type of barley; and the dots of yellow are lasthenia. Sometimes the plants seep into her dreams. “I know that when I’m dreaming about a certain species, I should go check that population and see what’s happening. And normally there’s something going on where it’s like grasshoppers came in and ate all the seed, or the seed is ripe and ready, and I gotta call in a crew,” she said. “I’ve really put my whole heart into this job.

Grass – it was a mistake about the legs.” I remember staring blankly at the page trying to parse what on earth was happening, going through scandalised childish versions of denial, anger, bargaining and depression, until finally reaching awestruck acceptance. Unreliable narrators hit hard in formative years, I guess. The realisation that a writer could get away with treating a reader like that was completely outrageous. My favourite book growing up What follows is a cop-out answer, so I’ll try to couch it in self-awareness. I miss when reading felt like a dependably easy, inexhaustibly voracious kind of pleasure. For a long while my preference was to have something like three books “on the go”, which now strikes me as completely absurd. For this reason, it’s genuinely tricky to extricate a single book as being a “favourite”, purely because reading always involved a certain amount of contingent rubbernecking between genres. I will say I hit a memorably sweet spot when pivoting between the boric acid pessaries of James Herriot’s Vet in a Spin at home, Kate Atkinson’s tricksy Behind the Scenes at the Museum for the bus journey, and Small Gods by Terry Pratchett waiting in my school locker. The book that changed me as a teenager Sensing I should have outgrown the schlock of RL Stine’s Goosebumps series and having raced through the far more sophisticated Point Horror books and their sexy American campfire kind of dread, my request as a 13-year-old for a “creepy book” meant the school librarian slipped Susan Hill’s The Bird of Night into my hands. I had never read anything like it: a controlled psychological portrait of cruelty, devotion, and the terror of a mannered life. I truly think I trusted all people far less once I’d finished that novel, and loved them all more intensely. The writer who changed my mind I started an undergraduate degree in theology but after a year switched to English literature. There were many reasons for this change, most probably wrong-headed or to do with cowardice, but I do remember a glancing use of Gerard Manley Hopkins on a divinity faculty seminar handout, which hit me like a revelation. If I was going to spend time grappling with faith and doubt, I wanted more of that on the reading list. The book I reread I suspect I will read Ali Smith’s The Accidental until my eyes fall out (and then I will require recitations). Centring on a family forced to deal with a new presence in their lives, it’s been interesting to track how my sympathies for different characters shift as I grow older and nestle into new generational roles. The book I could never read again I foolishly thought any link between me and Ingela P Arrhenius’s Where’s Mr Duck? must end when my son reached a certain age, but alas, my 18-month-old daughter adores it. A final page features felt flaps over a mirror – “And where are YOU?” – so I am confronted by my drained, flagging resolve every time. Yet the day will come when she does not climb into my lap and extend its pages toward me, and that will be the worst day of my life. My comfort read Anything by Saki. You have time to read one of his short stories right now. Some are nasty little acts of mischief, some lugubriously camp fancies. There’s satire, folklore, sass and starch.

The final batch will roll off the Swiss food firm’s production lines this month, with the decision blamed on dwindling sales of the 54-year-old brand. “We know fans will be disappointed to see it go,” said a Nestlé spokesperson. “We have seen a decline in the sales of Breakaway over the past few years and, unfortunately, we had to make the difficult decision to discontinue it.” For biscuit eaters of a certain age, even those who have not bought a pack for ages, the catchy 1983 “Don’t take away my Breakaway” ad jingle is indelibly planted in their brain. The cartoon memorably featured the “meanest geezer in the city” being pulled into line by his mum’s threat: “I’ll take away your Breakaway.” The decision is another blow for consumers who often struggle to let go of the brands beloved of their youth. At the end of last year there was outrage after Nestlé similarly canned Caramac, ending what for some had been a 60-year love affair with the caramel-flavoured bar. Fans of the Breakaway took to X, formerly Twitter, to complain. Carrie @Crystal18429762 spoke for many: “After buying Breakaway chocolate biscuits for the past three decades the manufacturers have announced that they are to stop making them in March. Yet another thing from the past being done away with. Such a lovely biscuit too.” Other X users were less heartfelt to see a treat launched in 1970 by Rowntree Mackintosh – which was acquired by Nestlé in 1988 – dispatched to biscuit heaven: “I patiently await the petition to sign,” said one with tongue firmly in cheek. In the same breath Nestlé also called time on Yorkie biscuit bars but thank goodness not the full-chocolate version, with the company confirming those are “staying for good”. Nestlé said the clear-out of older brands meant it could focus on its best-performing confectionery, as well as “develop exciting new innovations to delight consumers’ tastebuds”. Those in need of a final Breakway fix will be able to find packs in Sainsbury’s throughout February and March while stocks last. If you are more concerned about what will happen next in this biscuit end times, the future of the stablemate Blue Riband appears to be secure, for the time being at least.

Allow me to change your mind", "date": null, "author": "Jessica Reed", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "“Murderer! You’re a murderer!” That is what my French mother shouts down the phone line – right after I tell her I had grouse for dinner. “Grouse?” she gasps. “Yes,” I say, using my nonchalant voice. “We went hunting and shot two of them. Plump ones. I braised them in a mushroom broth and served them with stewed apples and potato mash.” She shrieks. “I can’t believe you killed an animal!” “Mom! Didn’t you just make lamb tagine?” Pause. “Yes, I cooked a Moroccan tagine with raisins, green olives and a lot of cinnamon,” she replies defensively. “I made it with lamb I bought at the farmers’ market. What’s your point?” “My point is,” I say, “where do you think that lamb came from? Did it magically appear on your plate?” It was not a conversation I was going to win, not even with a French woman living in the land of duck foie gras, cured pork sausage and snails – all of which was killed far less humanely than the grouse on my plate. That is what I was trying to tell Mom: hunting may be morally complex, but it is a far more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than the factory-farmed products most people eat. I am not arguing for everyone to go out and hunt their dinner – that would be absurd. But the reflexive disdain for hunters on much of the left feels misplaced. Let me explain. *** If I truly am a murderer, I am not a very vicious one. I killed my first mule deer on public land in northern Montana at the tail end of a five-hour hunt in frigid temperatures on Thanksgiving. My partner and I had been tracking signs all day – hiking up and down ridges, glassing hillsides with binoculars – until I could not feel my toes. We were ready to give up when the curious eyes of two does landed on us. With their oversized ears and mile-long eyelashes, they looked dainty and otherworldly, as if they had stepped out of a Grimm fairy tale. The one in front, maybe 80 yards (73 metres) away, studied me. She had one leg slightly raised, the others rooted in snow, frozen in that split-second decision: flee or stay? Mule deer are naturally more curious and less skittish than their white-tailed cousins, which gave me a crucial edge. I had one extra heartbeat to steady my breath, nestle the rifle into my shoulder, and count to three while exhaling. I pulled the trigger. The shot echoed across the ridge. The doe’s knees buckled and she collapsed. My chest seized – I wanted to give the doe a quick death. I reloaded and fired again, trying to stay steady as adrenaline coursed through my body. I walked to her, stroked her soft ears and burst into tears. Looking back, I am not embarrassed by my reaction; it seemed fitting to the gravity of the experience. In that instant – and there is really no other way to describe it – I felt an immense surge of love for that animal. It reminds me of what the British philosopher Julian Baggini has wondered about modern food gathering: is disgust at meat eating really a sign of a more civilized society, or simply a mark of one that has become detached from the realities of life and death? *** My ascent to the world of hunting was not linear. I moved to the United States 10 years ago, carrying with me the wide-eyed fascination so many French people have for America. I had a slightly embarrassing love for its excess, its swagger, the bigness of it all. But more than that, it was the land – from the Redwood forests to the Gulf Stream waters, as the song goes – that felt like freedom for me. During my first year in New York City, I befriended Caty and Ryan, two journalists recently transplanted from Santa Fe, New Mexico. Everything about their lives struck me as exotic. Their hallway was cluttered with skis, climbing gear and camping equipment that suggested a life lived outdoors. Mountaineering magazines were strewn on the dining table, and a print of Ansel Adams’s celebrated photograph of the high desert hung on their kitchen wall, austere and magnetic. Soon, Ryan taught me how to fly fish in the rivers of upstate New York – a hobby so quintessentially American I thought it came with its own Yankee passport. Standing in the Beaverkill river, casting in cold thigh-high waters, I was enthralled. When I caught my first rainbow trout, I held its iridescent body underwater and gasped at its beauty. I removed the hook from its mouth and let it go. That winter, Ryan prepared a meal that shifted everything I thought I knew about hunting. Over candlelight, he brought out quails he had shot that fall in his native North Dakota. They had been braised for five hours in apple cider and sage. Silence fell on the table as we ate. Each bite came with the appreciation of what it took for it to reach our plates: a punishing cross-country road trip followed by freezing mornings traipsing through fields with Magnolia, his trusty hunting Labrador, by his side. This food carried a story that was a far cry from the plastic-wrapped slabs of meat stacked in supermarket coolers, and far more interesting. *** *** Hunting has always had a terrible reputation in France, especially in affluent cities. In the court of public opinion – especially on the political left, where my heart is firmly anchored – hunters are viewed with suspicion, if not outright contempt. It is not without reason. Hunting has long been associated with a retrograde political party formerly called Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition, a right-leaning group that seemed to be populated by portly men who sported mustaches and red cheeks, and had an inclination to drink wine before noon. Now, hunting still only makes headlines when accidents happen. So perhaps it is no surprise the sport is in decline: perception matters. In France, about 58% of hunting permit holders are aged 55 or older, and only 3% are women. In the UK, where I lived for eight years, hunting is mostly seen as an upper-class pursuit, and the lingering stain of fox hunting makes it hard to separate the sport in the public eye from cruelty. But in the US, hunting is more widely practiced across groups – even across party lines. Kamala Harris’s former running mate, Tim Walz, for example, is a dedicated wild turkey hunter in Minnesota. In Missoula, where I live – a blue dot in a red state – my hunting community includes conservationists, outdoor enthusiasts, university lecturers and, more prosaically, people simply looking to fill the freezer. There are plenty of Maga types too, I am sure – they are just not in my social circles. Native tribes across the state, who overwhelmingly skew Democrat, hold hunting rights for both big and small game on their lands; their ancestral foodways are considered sacred. More women than ever before are joining the ranks. I am one of them. So is my friend DeAnna Bublitz, who wanted to be more intentional with her meat consumption. “I figured that if I couldn’t pull the trigger myself, I should probably stop eating meat,” she says. But entering the hunting world dominated by older men felt intimidating. “I was lucky to have a female friend who is a top-notch hunter and willing to loan me gear and mentor me. That made all the difference,” she says. “There are a lot of barriers for folks who didn’t grow up hunting – cost and mentorship are two of the biggest in my mind.” The experience transformed her. Her mentor not only taught her practical skills but also helped her process the complicated emotions that come with killing an animal. Eventually, DeAnna started Deer Camp, a free gear library for hunters, and now mentors new hunters herself – including me. “The folks I see expressing interest want to eat healthier, more ethical meat and they’re a more diverse crowd – often younger, with a lot of women and people from the LGBTQIA+ community. But those same groups may not feel safe going into the woods alone or with a stranger. How we depict hunting in media, and who we choose to represent it, can go a long way in either making people feel welcome or shutting them out. The experiences you can have out there are incredible, though – fostering new friendships alongside a sense of stewardship for the land.” In other words, if you are concerned with the health of our ecosystems, maybe – just maybe – I could change your mind. *** Perhaps this is where I should address the elephant in the room: firearms. In the US, thanks to the 1937 Pittman-Robertson Act, taxes on firearms and ammunition are funneled directly into wildlife conservation and habitat restoration. Over the decades, it has generated more than $15bn. Hunters are required to take a gun safety course, which means we start out more educated about risks than the broader gun-owning population. While I would love to call myself an archer, which arguably demands more skills, most of us use rifles: they are accurate and they tend to make for a quicker death. Still, I feel deep ambivalence about firearms. Gun culture unsettles me, and the proliferation of semi-automatic weapons in particular terrifies me. I cannot imagine a world where assault-style rifles belong in civilian hands – let alone with 18-year-olds. I often think of Australia, a country with plenty of big-game hunters, where a single mass shooting in 1996 prompted sweeping reform led by a conservative government. That policy shift ended mass shootings (and firearm suicides dropped, too). It is the kind of success story I wish we could claim here. What makes it harder to stomach is how far the NRA has drifted. Once an organization rooted in hunting and safety, it has become a cynical lobby that trades in fear and division. Take Ryan Busse, a longtime gun executive and keen hunter. He quit his role after watching the gun lobby embrace far-right politics to make a buck – then ran for governor of Montana last year (he lost). Writing in the Guardian, he argued that “it’s up to responsible gun owners and others who care about our country to speak out against [the gun lobby’s] egregiously irresponsible behavior and in favor of commonsense laws like universal background checks and extreme risk protection orders”. Stories like his underline what often gets lost: for many hunters, firearms are a means to an end, not an identity. *** *** I often think of this: hunters and vegetarians – both judged by others, both right – are more alike than either would admit. It is a complex comparison, but consider this: both think deeply about what they eat. They spend a lot of time pondering food ethics: good quality sustenance, preferably sourced locally. Both care about ecosystems and how to preserve them for future generations. Both worry about animal welfare. And yet in western society, veganism holds the moral high ground. Never mind that many plant-based products come shrink-wrapped in plastic and shipped across oceans. The ingredients in vegan snacks – soy, palm oil, cacao, quinoa, coconut, bananas – are rarely local; they rely on extractive systems, exploitative labor and long-distance freight. Large-scale monocropping for soy, corn and wheat depletes soil and accelerates biodiversity loss. This is not a purity test. All I am saying is that eating ethically today is nearly impossible – vegan or not. But most wild game meat? It is sustainable, when conservation practices are observed. And I would argue that it is the most ethical meat one can consume. “Hunters are removing animals, that’s true,” Rebecca Mowry, a wildlife biologist with Montana fish, wildlife and parks, told me. “But they also tend to be extremely passionate about those animals, and deeply invested in making sure they’re still here for future generations.” Each year, state biologists like her set hunting quotas to address overpopulation. Hunters then pay for licenses – or enter lotteries for tags – and those fees directly support wildlife management programs. This system exists for a reason: unchecked animal populations can cause real damage. Deer and hogs, for example, can overgraze and destroy entire ecosystems. In France, the National Forestry Office warns that more than 50% of state-owned forests are ecologically out of balance due to exploding populations of deer, roe deer and wild boar. In Texas, feral hogs are so invasive they are costing millions in the agriculture industry – this very newspaper called it “an aporkalypse”. Mowry says hunting “is a very valuable tool to help manage ecosystems, for multiple reasons”. Without enough predators or healthy migration corridors, she explained, big game populations can balloon beyond what the land can support. “We’re not living in untouched wilderness anymore,” she says. “With all the development on winter range, we’ve altered the balance – and hunting helps restore it.” In his book How the World Eats, Baggini, the British philosopher, describes the Hadza, Tanzania’s last hunter-gatherer society. “They move with the seasons,” he writes, “taking from the natural environment only what they need to survive, leaving it able to replenish itself – so that any extraction of resources can go on indefinitely.” That, Baggini observes, is the very definition of sustainability. Thosh Collins, an Indigenous health educator, author and experienced hunter, echoed this when he told me: “When we harvest, process and cook our food, we’re literally taking the land into our bodies.” His family also seasonally forages on their land in the Arizona desert and grows traditional foods such as corn, bean and squash. For Collins, meat carries spirit – not just calories. “From the Indigenous perspective, a hunter possesses the ability to transform death into nourishment,” he says. “One of the most fascinating paradoxes of our lives is that life feeds off of death. Life energy crosses from one form to another. No one person is exempt from this. If you’re living, you’re taking up space from other sentient life forms trying to thrive.” His O’odham ancestors never separated sustenance from reverence, and neither does he. After a kill, he performs a giving-of-thanks ritual to help send the animal’s spirit on. Nothing about the act is casual; everything is deliberate. Part of what makes a hunter successful is the ability to know the habitat they are in: you have to learn to read the land, understand how changing seasons affect species, and how fires, droughts and climate shifts shape entire ecosystems. Which is why I do not know any group – aside from Native tribes and biologists – more attuned to the health of elk herds, the decline of pronghorns, or the migration patterns of Canada geese than hunters. Yes, hunters kill animals. But Mowry, the Montana biologist, also points out hunters “are largely responsible for some of the most successful wildlife restorations in the country”. How? They fight for public land access – and helped win a political battle earlier this year. They campaign for clean water, wildlife corridors and the removal of barbed-wire fences that kill mule deer and antelope. They report poachers. They fill out wildlife surveys that provide essential data to state officials. Some groups lobby against encroaching development; others build education programs. Many donate meat to food banks. They mentor newcomers, volunteer their time and skills, and open their tables to others. In other words, hunters do not just understand interconnectedness – they live it. Can we all say the same? *** *** After seven years in New York, I moved out west to Montana with my partner Ben, an enthusiastic outdoorsman. The move to the Rockies was a culture shock: I left skyscrapers for snow-capped mountains, $23 cocktails in Manhattan for sticky floors in boisterous dive bars. It was also the perfect terrain to learn how to hunt my own meat. The learning curve was steep. For months, Ben patiently fielded my endless questions: how do you follow a game trail? When do bucks rut – and why do their lymph nodes swell? What’s an elk herd’s migration pattern? Should I worry about chronic wasting disease? I had to learn how to move in the woods: slowly, methodically, discerning broken branches, bedding areas or fresh droppings. I practiced reading wind direction using a neat little indicator powder, studied how to scan hillsides using binoculars, and mastered the art of opening snacks without making any noise. Still, I was afraid I would not be able to carry the responsibility of taking an animal’s life. I had to remind myself that by my standards eating a burger at McDonald’s or chicken strips at my local bar was a worse choice. I studied and passed the hunter safety course. I joined Venery, a women’s hunting group, and spent time with them at the shooting range, familiarizing myself with a tool that until then had been foreign and terrifying to me: a .308 Winchester rifle. Learning with other women gave me the confidence I needed to later go in the field, where I had both amazing and dispiriting experiences. Hunting, after all, is never a promise — it’s unpredictable, and often hard. To kill is to bear witness to the cycle of life. No longer can you outsource the unpleasantness – not to Whole Foods, not to Lidl, not even to your local farmer. Digging your fingers through the entrails, you take ultimate responsibility for your own sustenance. I hesitate to say this, but it is an elating feeling: with it comes a sense of self-reliance long forgotten, especially when everything you would ever want can be delivered to you overnight by underpaid delivery workers. Hunting is the opposite of that: it is patient, demanding, gnarly. It comes with smells, textures and colors rarely seen by anyone eating commercial meat. It is also new language: as you spend days climbing hills and crossing marshes for a chance to complete the task, you live in the present. Collins, the O’odham hunter, told me that his sister is a former vegan. Now, she “will only eat the meat my dad and I hunt because she knows we did it with a good heart and mind and that a ceremony was performed for the buck to send his spirit to rejoin his relatives”. For Collins, hunting is part of a broader circle of sustenance passed down from his ancestors. It’s not just about the meat, but about gratitude, ceremony and a sense of duty. “Foodways is about doing things on the land with people you love, for people you love,” he said. *** These days, I eat far less store-bought meat – though I will admit a weakness for poultry, a whole ethical mess of its own. Instead, we often have elk backstraps, ground venison and summer sausage – all processed at home, wrapped in butcher paper adorned with handwritten details and the processing date on it, stacked deep in my freezer chest. Last fall, I killed a young whitetail buck. Ben and I butchered it in two hours, under the sun filtering through the ponderosa pines. We took with us tenderloins, backstraps, shanks, legs, with leftovers going to scavengers – nothing going to waste. Back home, I marinated the deer’s heart – a perfectly tender piece of meat – in a mixture of soy, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, thyme and vinegar. I grilled it alongside a pile of red peppers, zucchinis and onions, and served it with buttered sourdough bread. My golden retriever, Billie, happy to act as my sous chef, ate the scraps.

You see someone across the room and think, “They look interesting – just my cup of tea.” And when you finally work up the courage to chat to them, it’s like you’ve known each other forever. This recipe is that, in a soup. Lovely sweet, creamy flavours, like a hug in a mug, plus a bonus garnish to take the menage to the next level. And did I mention it’s easy? Sit back my friend, because no heavy-duty chopping is required. Just pile in the veg for a warm, snug sit in the oven while you put the kettle on and slip into something a little more comfortable. If you’ve scanned the ingredients list and have most of the orange bits and bobs, but maybe only one type of pumpkin, fewer carrots, or a turnip instead of a swede, worry not! The veg is easily substituted. Just take a squiz at the photo (below) of the tray and try to fill yours with about the same amount of whatever veg you do have. You have carte blanche to roast any colour-coordinated veg combos and blitz to a soup: tomatoes, capsicums, red onion; all sorts of greens and herbs. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning For a Fodmap-friendly option, sub out the onion and garlic for half a teaspoon of asafoetida – a spice which mimics the flavour of alliums. Using your own stock is always more cost-effective, but don’t stress about making stock from scratch if you’ve none to hand. I’ve had friends with romantic notions of writing down their bubba’s chicken soup recipes, only to discover the “secret ingredient” isn’t love: it’s stock cubes. These canary-yellow cubes and powders, be they Massel, Vegeta or similar, are a brilliant way to add flavour and that special something to all sorts of dishes. Many stock cubes are also vegan, even if they’re called “chicken flavour”. But be sure to taste your dish after adding the cube as it will invariably mean you’ll need to add less salt. This is especially true if you’re using a shop-bought liquid stock, as these are usually jacked up with sodium. Another thing that gives this recipe extra flavour is the schmaltz – the Yiddish word for chicken fat (or any fat, actually). You can apply the same schmaltz-making principles to plant-based dishes. When roasting veggies, just double down on the olive oil and toss in some extra juicy veggies such as capsicum. The juices can be used afterwards in a sauce for a pasta. Orange vegetable one-tray soup – recipe In this recipe I’ve suggested some “accents” that will help bring another dimension to your veg-packed soup. Feel free to choose one, depending on your mood – curry leaves and coconut for fragrance, lime for spikiness, pomegranate seeds for pop-in-your-mouth astringency, cream and chives for cream-and-chive-iness. If you choose to garnish this soup with accent 5, note that rice seasoning is more of a sprinkle – like a Japanese dukkah Asian grocers sell different varieties, from nori-rich savoury-sweet furikake to spicy shichimi togarashi (“seven peppers” or “seven spices”). Serves 4–6, plus generous leftovers 1kg kent pumpkin, cut into wedges ½ butternut pumpkin, halved, seeds removed 2 medium carrots, unpeeled 1 sweet potato, unpeeled, halved 1 swede, halved 1 onion, skin on, halved 4 garlic cloves, skin on 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp sea salt 6 cups (1.5L) vegetable stock or water 1 good-quality stock cube ½ tsp ground white pepper A rasp of nutmeg Juice of 1 orange 1 thumb-sized knob of fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated Accent 1 20 fresh curry leaves, fried with 1 tsp brown mustard seeds, or 40 dried curry leaves, gently warmed in 1 cup (250ml) olive oil and left to infuse for 5 minutes Coconut cream Accent 2 8–10 lime leaves, finely sliced Coconut cream Lime juice Thai basil Accent 3 Pomegranate molasses Fresh pomegranate seeds Ground sumac Yoghurt Accent 4 Single (pure) cream Chopped chives Accent 5 Miso paste Yoghurt Rice seasoning Arrange the pumpkins, carrots, sweet potato and swede on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Nestle in the onion halves and garlic cloves. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and toss to coat. Crank the oven to 180C (fan-forced) and roast for 45 minutes or until all the veggies are extremely relaxed and very susceptible to forking. Remove from the oven. Once cooled, take the skin off the pumpkins and scoop out the flesh from the sweet potato and swede. Slip the skin off the onion and pop the lush softened garlic cloves out of their skins with a squeeze. Be sure to scrape all the syrupy goodness from the bottom of the pan, too; this is veggie schmaltz. Bring the stock or water to the boil and dissolve the stock cube in it. Allow the roasted veg and stock (or water) to cool briefly, then combine and blitz until super smooth, using a stick blender or in batches in a blender.

I would need to lie down low – on an inflatable lilo, maybe – with a small cushion and a flask of coffee and whisky. I would need to have a penknife, too, so I could cut the spears when they reach the perfect height, which is often at midnight. The boiling time of asparagus varies according to its thickness and how recently it was picked. Broadly speaking, though, string-thin spears need 30 seconds, pencil-thick ones a minute or two, little-finger size ones two to three minutes, and jumbo, thumb-thick spears up to seven minutes, or longer if they are older and therefore tougher. If your bunch is made up of neat, evenly sized spears, it’s simple to calculate the boiling time, but if your bunch is a mismatched one, a bit of sorting is worthwhile, so you can stagger the cooking times with the new potatoes. Regardless of size, it’s important that the salted water is at a steady boil and that the asparagus remains bright green (if they lose that colour and turn khaki, that’s a sign of overcooking). The cooked spears should also hold their shape – soldiers standing at ease, as opposed to rag dolls. But before cooking is trimming, for which there are two schools of thought. The first is to use a potato peeler to pare away the outer layers of the tough woody ends, which makes the asparagus look a bit like a sharpened pencil. The other way is to bend the spear until it breaks at the point between tough and tender, which can seem wasteful, but is generally spot on, and the way I prefer. Also, those woody ends can be kept in the fridge, along with parsley and basil stems, for that stock that never gets made. Pull the leaves off a small bunch of basil and a small bunch of parsley to make a salsa verde, or green sauce. I have written about salsa verde before – how the proportions of ingredients depend on how strongly flavoured they are, and on your personal taste – so treat this recipe from the reliable Ricette Regionali Italiane as an adaptable template. Serve at any time, and also just after midnight. Potatoes, eggs, asparagus and green sauce Serves 4 1 small bunch basil 1 small bunch parsley 3-5 anchovy fillets, to taste 1-2 garlic cloves, peeled 1 tsp capers, drained 40g pine nuts, or almonds 100-150ml olive oil Salt 1 kg small waxy potatoes, scrubbed or peeled (halved if big) 1 small bunch asparagus 6 eggs, fridge-cold Butter or olive oil, for serving (optional) Pick the leaves off the basil and parsley, and put them in a blender with the anchovy fillets, garlic, capers, pine nuts and 50ml of the olive oil, thenblend to a rough paste. Scrape into a bowl and add another 50-100ml olive oil, stirring as you go, to achieve a consistency you like. Taste and add salt, if required. Bring a small pan of water to a boil. Lower in the eggs and boil for eight minutes if you want a soft centre, or 10 for hard-boiled. Lift out the eggs and put them in a bowl of cold water for two minutes. Gently crack the shells with the back of a spoon, return the eggs to the cold water for another minute, then peel them. Meanwhile, put 1kg scrubbed or peeled new potatoes (halve them if they’re big) in a pan large to enough to hold a small bunch of asparagus too, then cover with water and add salt. Bring to a boil, then cook for 10 minutes, until they are tender; add the asparagus according to its size, so it is cooked at the same time as the potatoes. Drain and tip both on to a warm platter, then nestle the halved eggs and (if you want) curls of butter or some olive oil in the cracks. Serve with bread and the green sauce on the side.

Greenfield said in a letter posted by his co-founder, Ben Cohen, that he could no longer “in good conscience” remain an employee of a business that he argued had been muzzled by the UK-listed Unilever, despite an agreement protecting its social mission when it was taken over in 2000. “It is profoundly disappointing to come to the conclusion that that independence, the very basis of our sale to Unilever, is gone,” he said. “If the company couldn’t stand up for the things we believed, then it wasn’t worth being a company at all.” Greenfield, who along with Cohen has no control over operations but had remained an employee to help maintain its founding social mission, called it one of the “hardest and most painful decisions” he had ever made. Greenfield’s resignation is the latest development in a bitter dispute since Unilever backtracked on an agreement allowing Ben &amp; Jerry’s to not sell ice-cream in occupied Palestinian territories, which had been heavily criticised in Israel. Unilever subsequently sold Ben &amp; Jerry’s Israel division to a local operator, prompting the ice-cream maker to sue its parent company before reaching a settlement in 2022. Last year, Ben &amp; Jerry’s launched a legal action against Unilever, accusing it of threatening to dismantle the board and sue directors over their public statements in support of Palestinians in Gaza. The letter comes as Unilever prepares to spin out its ice-cream division, Magnum Ice Cream Company (TMICC), which also includes Wall’s, with a main listing in Amsterdam and secondary listings in London and New York. Before the new business’s first capital markets day last week, Cohen and Greenfield published an open letter to the board and potential investors, calling for the brand to be “released”. The letter also argued that Unilever’s move to dismantle Ben &amp; Jerry’s social mission had devalued the business. Cohen and Greenfield have been looking for investors to help them buy the brand back, but Unilever has insisted it is not for sale. Cohen said that, amid tensions with Unilever, the brand had tried to engineer a sale to investors at a fair market value of $1.5bn-$2.5bn (£1.1bn-£1.8bn) but the proposal was rejected. “The problem is that Unilever and Magnum don’t want to sell, so they are not allowing any of these potential investors to see the financials,” said Cohen. A spokesperson for TMICC said it would be “forever grateful” to Greenfield for his role co-founding the company, but that the business “disagreed with his perspective” and had sought to engage both co-founders in a “constructive conversation” on how to strengthen the brand. In May, Cohen was charged with “crowding and obstructing” others after he was arrested while protesting against the Gaza blockade during a US Senate hearing. Video footage recorded at the hearing and posted by Cohen on social media showed him being hauled out of the committee room, handcuffed and escorted away. Ben &amp; Jerry’s was founded in 1978 after the two friends took a $5 correspondence course in ice-cream making. The pair – who met while at school in Merrick, on Long Island in New York – opened their first store in a renovated petrol station in Burlington, Vermont, with a mission to “advance human rights and dignity”. They chose fun, hippy names for their flavours, such as Cherry Garcia, after the late guitarist Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead – and even Cool Britannia. The company, which from 1985 began donating almost 8% of its annual pre-tax profits to charity, grew to become one of the biggest in the US. Its transition to mainstream international commercial success attracted the attention of then Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever. In 2000, Unilever struck a $326m deal to buy the business, a move that at the time reportedly did not please Greenfield, with stipulations including the creation of the brand’s own independent board to allow it to continue to take progressive stances on social and political issues and uphold its core values. “However much a [formerly] independent company will try to retain its identity and ethos, the corporate [buyer] will invariably call the shots in the long run,” said Nick Stockley, a partner and dispute resolution specialist at the law firm Mayo Wynne Baxter.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

David Stever – who led the company for almost two years having first joined it as a tour guide in 1988 – was “removed” from his post earlier this month, it has was claimed in a court filing from the US-based brand. Ben &amp; Jerry’s alleged in a submission to the US district court for the southern district of New York that Unilever, the UK-based consumer group that owns brands including Marmite and Dove, wanted to stop the boss from making political statements. Anuradha Mittal, the chair of Ben &amp; Jerry’s independent board, said: “Dave has courageously advanced the company’s social mission and values, has continued to drive innovation in its super premium product range, and has delivered strong financial results, far outpacing the rest of Unilever’s ice-cream business. “What Dave hasn’t done is what Unilever would like him to do, which is to oversee the dismantling of Ben &amp; Jerry’s mission, progressive values.” The court action is the latest episode in a testy relationship between the ice-cream brand and its parent group, which ousted its own chief executive, Hein Schumacher, last month and replaced him with its finance chief, Fernando Fernandez, to speed up a turnaround process. Last month, Ben &amp; Jerry’s accused Unilever of demanding that it stop publicly criticising Donald Trump. And in November it launched legal action against its parent, accusing the company of trying to block it from making public statements supporting Palestinian refugees in the conflict in Gaza. It claimed Unilever had breached the terms of a confidential settlement agreed in 2022 after a clash over plans to stop selling its products in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Ben &amp; Jerry’s, which was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in 1978, was bought by the UK-based consumer goods group in 2000. As part of the merger deal, an independent board was set up to protect the ice-cream brand’s mission and strong stance on social issues. Mittal also accused Unilever of wanted to dismantle that agreement, which he said had “protected Ben &amp; Jerry’s position as a wholly owned autonomous subsidiary, the very things that have created the company’s financial success and incredible brand loyalty among its fans. “That is why the independent board has sued Unilever and why Unilever is seeking to punish the chief executive.” The court filing said: “Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben &amp; Jerry’s personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever’s efforts to silence the social mission. “On 3 March 2025, Unilever informed the independent board that they were removing and replacing Mr Stever as Ben &amp; Jerry’s CEO.” Unilever fired back on Wednesday afternoon, seeking a dismissal of Ben &amp; Jerry’s earlier complaint. It said it supports Ben &amp; Jerry’s and its social advocacy work, but the social mission has evolved into advocacy for “one-sided, highly controversial, and polarizing topics that put Unilever, B&amp;J’s, and their employees at risk”. Unilever’s filing does not address the proposed amended complaint or Stever’s job. In a statement, Unilever said the 2000 agreement governed removal decisions, and it was “disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public”. Stever is still shown as chief executive on the Ben &amp; Jerry’s website. Ben &amp; Jerry’s and its lawyers did not immediately address requests for comment. The two parties have had a series of disputes in recent years, with particular tensions over Ben &amp; Jerry’s move to halt sales in the West Bank in 2021. Unilever blocked the attempt but was then sued by Ben &amp; Jerry’s. The latest row comes after Unilever announced plans to list its ice-cream business on the Amsterdam stock exchange. The listing will separate a division that makes five of the world’s top-selling 10 ice-cream brands, including Wall’s, Magnum and Ben &amp; Jerry’s. It also makes Cornetto, Viennetta, Carte d’Or and Breyers, which is big in the US.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

Ben Cohen told the Guardian that Unilever was pursuing a “corporate attack on free speech” by blocking the development of a special flavour in solidarity with the Palestinian people. It is understood the flavour had been approved by Ben &amp; Jerry’s independent board and first mooted about a year ago. Magnum, the group’s ice-cream arm, confirmed it had not gone ahead with the board’s suggestion for a Palestine product this summer. Cohen has mounted a “Free Ben &amp; Jerry’s” campaign to persuade Unilever to sell the brand to a group of socially minded investors who he says have pledged to allow it to continue its “social mission.” With an increasingly authoritarian Trump in the White House, Cohen says now is the time that “companies and anyone who believes in justice, freedom and peace stands up. This is the moment when it is most needed for Ben &amp; Jerry’s to be able to raise its voice. “It seems like since Trump got elected anything that Trump is against, DEI, black history, protesters’ rights to free speech, all those things got censored.” Previous Ben &amp; Jerry’s flavours with an activist bent have included “Save Our Swirled” to highlight the need for action at the 2015 Paris climate meetings, “I Dough, I Dough” to celebrate the legalisation of same-sex marriage at a US federal level, and “Home Sweet Honeycomb” in support of resettling refugees in Europe. Cohen’s criticisms, which he has backed up with a video posted on Instagram, are the latest blow in the acrimonious spat between the brand’s founders and owners. Unilever is planning to spin off the Magnum Ice Cream Company into a separate business, which it hopes to list in Amsterdam with secondary listings in London and New York. Those plans were this week delayed because of the US government shutdown, although they could proceed by the end of the year. Unilever said remained confident of implementing its demerger plans this year. Unilever and Magnum said Ben &amp; Jerry’s was “not for sale”. Magnum said: “The independent members of Ben &amp; Jerry’s board are not, and have never been, responsible for the Ben &amp; Jerry’s commercial strategy and execution.” Referring to the proposed pro-Palestinian flavour, a spokesperson said: “Recommendations are considered by Ben &amp; Jerry’s leadership, and management has determined it is not the right time to invest in developing this product.” The company said Ben &amp; Jerry’s was focused on “campaigns close to its communities” such as improved conditions in refugee accommodation in the UK and campaigning in defence of the first amendment and freedom of speech in the US. Magnum added: “We remain committed to Ben &amp; Jerry’s unique three-part mission – product, economic and social – and look forward to building on its success as an iconic, much-loved brand.” Unilever, the British owner of consumer brands ranging from Dove soap to Hellmann’s mayonnaise, bought Ben &amp; Jerry’s in 2000 for $326m, but agreed an unusual deal for the ice-cream brand to preserve an independent board with the ability to speak out on social justice issues. The founders argue that Unilever has reneged on that promise, particularly in relation to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as the Israeli government destroyed much of the territory. A spokesperson for Unilever said: “We have always sought to work constructively with the Ben &amp; Jerry’s teams to make sure we stayed true to the original agreement around the progressive, non-partisan social mission.” Ben &amp; Jerry’s was founded in 1978 by Cohen and Jerry Greenfield after the friends took a $5 correspondence course in ice-cream making. They opened their first store in a renovated petrol station in Burlington, Vermont, with a mission to “advance human rights and dignity”. Under Unilever, the pair have officially been paid employees with no formal role in the business beyond promoting its values as “brand ambassadors”. Cohen remains in that role, but Greenfield resigned from Ben &amp; Jerry’s in September, saying it had lost its independence. Cohen said Ben &amp; Jerry’s was being blocked from “making ice-cream with purpose”, and pledged to create a Palestine solidarity flavour in his own kitchen. Members of the public are being asked to name and help create the flavour in a two-week competition. He suggested it would be based on watermelon, itself a symbol of solidarity with the Palestinian people. The ice-cream, which would be created as a small batch under his personal Ben’s Best brand, will not be for sale, but is intended to draw attention to the cause of “rebuilding, and peace and dignity for the people of the region”. He has previously used the Ben’s Best brand, first created in 2016 to back leftwing Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, to support a number of causes. Ben &amp; Jerry’s has clashed repeatedly with its parent company over Palestinian rights. It refused to sell ice-cream in territories occupied by Israel, took legal action against Unilever when it sold the brand’s Israeli division to a local operator. In May the brand called Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide, a description used last month by a United Nations independent international commission of inquiry.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided not to proceed against 34 individuals days before their trial was due to start. Eight people had been facing charges of aggravated trespass and 26 protesters were charged with the new offence of “locking on”, which was introduced in the Public Order Act 2023. In a letter from the CPS, lawyers said charges were being dropped because there was “not enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction”. The charges related to a protest outside Unilever’s headquarters in London last September when Greenpeace activists blockaded the entrances in protest over the company’s alleged failure to tackle plastic pollution. Will McCallum, a co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “This is a bolt of good news in an otherwise bleak landscape for protest rights. Our activists were facing a combined total of up to 15 years in prison for standing up to one of the world’s largest plastic polluters. “The invented crime of ‘locking on’ is just one new tool in a well-stocked legal arsenal that is being used to stifle dissent and send peaceful protesters to jail. Previous governments brought in these laws and powers, but the responsibility lies with [the prime minister] Keir Starmer to end their chilling effect on democracy and repeal them.” The crime of locking on was one of a number of offences and powers created by the previous Conservative government in its crackdown on peaceful protest. Last year, one climate activist was sentenced to five years in prison, and four others to four years in prison, for taking part in a video call to discuss a planned protest. Greenpeace’s protest was part of a continuing campaign against Unilever after the company announced a major rollback of plastic reduction targets last year. Climbers scaled the headquarters and attached a large artwork to the outside wall. Activists also blocked the entrances to the building, locking themselves on to large models of the company’s flagship Dove products and a “dead dove” parody of the brand’s logo.

The pair, who no longer have a financial interest in Ben &amp; Jerry’s or any formal role, say they “feel compelled to speak out – as concerned individuals”. “We are deeply concerned that the commitments made to us, our employees, and our customers are being eroded.

The letter says: “We believe that the founding values are central to what Ben &amp; Jerry’s is, and cannot simply be discarded out of convenience or under political pressure.” Cohen added: “Ben &amp; Jerry’s was founded on a simple but radical premise: that our business could thrive and make outstanding products whilst standing up for progressive values. “We fought to ensure our social justice mission was protected by Unilever when the company was acquired, but over the past several years, this has been eroded, and the company’s voice has been muted. We won’t be silent any more. Authenticity has always been at the very heart of what we do, and stripping this away risks destroying the very value of Ben &amp; Jerry’s.

And none of it will be good. As the Trump administration has ramped up its assault on American democracy, many corporations have chosen to look the other way or to curry favor with the president. They have fired employees who were too outspoken in their criticism of Donald Trump – ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow, after Kimmel’s remarks about Maga’s reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk, is the latest example. Or corporations have muted their brand’s identification with progressive causes. One casualty is Jerry Greenfield, co-founder and namesake of Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice-cream. This week, he resigned from the company. He did so because, he said in a statement, the politically outspoken company had been “silenced”. The consumer goods company Unilever acquired Ben &amp; Jerry’s in 2000, for a reported $326m. At the time, it agreed to respect the company’s independence. No more, according to Greenfield. “Standing up for the values of justice, equity, and our shared humanity has never been more important,” Greenfield noted in explaining his resignation. But, he said: “Ben &amp; Jerry’s has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.” Ben &amp; Jerry’s crossed swords with Unilever last year when it sued the company for allegedly fighting its calls for a Gaza ceasefire and an end to US military support for Israel. The 2024 suit claimed that Unilever had threatened to dismantle the ice-cream company’s independent board and punish members if Ben &amp; Jerry’s issued a call for a ceasefire. (Unilever said it rejected “the claims made by B&amp;J’s social mission board”. Its motion to dismiss the lawsuit is pending.) Another flare-up occurred in March of this year, when, according to Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Unilever fired its chief executive, David Stever, over his work to advance the company’s “social mission”. If those allegations are true, Unilever would not be alone in trying to avoid offending the Trump administration or its supporters. This is just the latest sign that the era of corporate social and political responsibility is over. Ice-cream lovers will now have to choose between their taste buds and their consciences. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) requires that business leaders recognize, as Harvard Business School explains, that they “have a responsibility to do more than simply maximize profits for shareholders and executives. Rather, they have a social responsibility to do what’s best – not just for their companies, but for people, the planet, and society at large.” The CSR movement really took off about 40 to 50 years ago when businesses realized that they could carve out a niche and attract investment from people who wanted to make money and stay true to their values. Ben &amp; Jerry’s was founded in 1978 during the heyday of CSR, by Greenfield and Ben Cohen. It was upfront about the issues it cared about and the values it sought to promote. The list was long, but it included racial justice, refugee rights, climate, LGBTQ+ rights and democracy. The Association of Corporate-Citizenship Professionals traces the roots of CSR back to the 18th century. At that time, religious groups would not invest, and would urge their members not to invest, in businesses that did not advance their values. Those included the slave trade and businesses that supplied the instruments of war. Fast forward to the start of the 20th century, when in 1928, the Pioneer Fund became one of the first mutual funds to promote socially responsible investing, which meant avoiding companies producing alcohol or tobacco, or promoting gambling. Almost a century later, the Business Roundtable included in its statement on the purpose of a corporation the following: “We commit to … supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.” Some progressives have criticized CSR, describing it as a charade and a public relations tactic that left the profit motive intact and did not require substantial changes in the way companies did business. But Ben &amp; Jerry’s did more than brand itself as interested in social justice and political equality. As its 2024 lawsuit made clear, Ben &amp; Jerry’s has wanted to take political stands even if it meant that it would lose some customers. A year earlier, in March 2023, as Newsweek reports, Cohen “shocked many” by speaking out against the US providing military aid to Ukraine.” (An ally said he opposed Russia’s invasion but wanted a diplomatic solution.) While from time to time, the company has been accused of not living up to its values, not surprisingly, conservatives have targeted Ben &amp; Jerry’s for being “woke”. Some have tried to organize a boycott to protest what they see as its radical left politics. That’s perhaps why Unilever apparently wanted to pull back Ben &amp; Jerry’s activism. What we are witnessing now in the way of corporate acquiescence to the rise of authoritarianism is a familiar story. There are plenty of examples. Take Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. There, as the political economist Gábor Scheiring argues: “Since 2010 Orbán has been using the momentum created by popular anger at the failures of liberal policies to build up his own system: authoritarian capitalism. A system that is deeply illiberal but capitalist: private property and the profit logic still dominate, but the state bureaucracy and its institutions are subdued to the enrichment of the preferred national economic elite.” There is ample evidence that Trump is succeeding in that same endeavor.

Wild Cosmetics, founded six years ago by two childhood friends, Freddy Ward and Charlie Bowes-Lyon, has been bought by Unilever, the maker of a host of brands including Marmite, Dove soap, and Axe, Lynx and Sure deodorant. After first approaching the pair six months ago, Unilever has acquired their upmarket brand – which specialises in “refillable, natural, body care” – as it seeks to shift its portfolio towards premium and high-growth brands. Wild makes premium deodorant case-and-refill packs starting from £12, lip balm packs from £7.20, body wash packs from £10 and hand wash packs priced from £15.40, using plant-based ingredients, with refillable, plastic-free packaging. The Brixton-based startup, which employs 100 people, changed hands for an undisclosed sum but is thought to be valued at £230m. Ward and Bowes-Lyon, who is a first cousin three times removed of the late Queen Mother, launched Wild because they wanted to tackle the issue of single-use plastics and spotted a gap in the market for sustainable bathroom products. The deal will make the pair – who are in their 30s – millionaires, as they are thought to own nearly 26% and 17% of the company respectively. They will stay on to run the business, with the same team and from the same location in south London. Bowes-Lyon, the chief marketing officer, said joining Unilever marked an “exciting new chapter for Wild”. He told the Guardian that having access to the consumer group’s distribution networks and research and development would help Wild in its “ultimate mission to remove plastic from the average Joe’s bathroom” and to “make sustainability mainstream”. This could mean lower prices for consumers. “With scale, essentially prices come down,” he said. Bowes-Lyon was not concerned about the brand losing its independence. “The brand will stay pretty much as it is. And Unilever see themselves as a kind of support role for us, to help us grow up.” He said Wild, run by Ward, the chief executive, had “very extensive” discussions with Unilever over the past six months and was “very comfortable with the arrangements”. During a two-year earn-out period, the business will have to meet certain sales targets. Bowes-Lyon believes that Unilever is serious about sustainability, noting that it had trialled more than 3,000 types of non-plastic packaging. Wild is preparing to launch a new product this summer in the deodorant sector. Its sales jumped by 77% to £46.9m in 2023, resulting in its first pre-tax profit, of £509,000, after facing significant cost pressures the year before, according to its most recent accounts filed at Companies House. Fabian Garcia, the president of Unilever’s personal care arm, said: “The brand’s innovative approach to formulations and packaging, and social-first marketing, has made Wild an unmissably superior brand and a perfect complement to our personal care portfolio.” Wild is backed by investors including the founders of Innocent Drinks via their investment vehicle JamJar Investments, along with Redbus Ventures, also based in London, and Amsterdam-based Slingshot Ventures. Unilever has snapped up a number of premium consumer brands in recent years, including the biotech haircare specialist K18 and the UK snack brand Graze. The consumer group is acquiring Wild while it is in the midst of a shake-up, which involves 7,500 job losses, as it trims its food portfolio to focus on its biggest sellers. It is spinning off its Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Wall’s ice-cream division, and announcing plans for a main stock market listing in Amsterdam in a blow to the London stock market. It will have secondary listings in London and New York. Unilever’s chief financial officer, Fernando Fernandez, was promoted to chief executive last month, replacing Hein Schumacher, who was ousted after less than two years at the helm. Fernandez previously ran Unilever’s beauty and wellbeing division, one of its fastest-growing businesses.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

The consumer goods company behind brands ranging from Dove beauty products to Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice-cream was seen as perhaps the foremost proponent of corporate ethics – particularly under the tenure of its Dutch former boss Paul Polman. On Friday, the London-based firm’s current chief executive appeared to signal a strategic U-turn for the company, which is valued at £94bn on the London Stock Exchange. In an interview with Bloomberg, Hein Schumacher confirmed plans to water down the company’s ethical pledges on a range of issues including plastic usage and pay. The shift comes amid a wider trend of pressure from shareholders in corporations ranging from banks to oil companies to cut costs and focus more on stock market performance than green projects. Unilever, one of the largest users of plastic packaging in the world, had previously promised to halve its use of virgin plastics by 2025. Instead, it will now aim for a reduction of a third by 2026, Bloomberg reported. The less ambitious target equates to about 100,000 tonnes more fresh plastic every year. The company is also abandoning a pledge to pay direct suppliers a living wage by 2030, instead proposing fair pay for suppliers accounting for half its annual spend on goods and services by 2026. It is also dropping a promise to spend €2bn (£1.7bn) a year with diverse businesses by 2025 and a commitment that 5% of its workforce will be made up of people with disabilities by the same year. Schumacher said people’s focus on environmental and social issues was “cyclical”. “When you have a huge drought for a number of months but everything else is going fine, the attention is on climate. These days it’s about wars and rightly so, that’s at the forefront. “I’m not going to shout that we’re saving the world, but I want to make sure that in everything that we do, that it is indeed better,” he added. He insisted that the company could still “make a difference” in the four key areas of climate, plastics, nature and people’s livelihoods. Nina Schrank, the head of plastics at Greenpeace UK, said Unilever bosses “should hang their heads in shame”. “Hein Schumacher and his board are well aware of the ruinous impact of their plastic pollution,” she said. “The tsunami of plastic they produce each year meant their existing targets were already not fit for purpose. We needed much more. And so rather than doubling down, they’re quietly dressing up their backpedalling and low ambition as worthy pragmatism.” Unilever’s dilution of its ethical stance follows a period of worsening performance in which the company’s shares have fallen by 8% since Schumacher took over in July 2023. Under Polman – and his successor Alan Jope – Unilever became increasingly involved in ethical initiatives. It promised to invest €1bn over 10 years in green projects and provided funding from its cleaning brand Domestos for a Unicef project to improve access to toilets in India. The firm last month released plans to cut 7,500 jobs globally and spin off its ice-cream division as part of an overhaul aimed at saving about €800m over the next three years.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

Jealous? Me?", "date": null, "author": "David Barnett", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "First, a confession: I have not read Jennifer L Armentrout’s latest novel, The Primal of Blood and Bone. Nor have I sniffed it, or licked it. Which might be an odd thing to do, but for the fact that a special edition of the romantasy book has been released with garlic-infused ink. Armentrout is a hugely-successful “hybrid” author, both self- and traditionally published, and has made the New York Times bestseller list on numerous occasions. She writes in the currently insanely popular romantic fantasy market, and her new novel, the latest in a series, features vampire-analogy monsters called the Craven. Enter stage right: Hellmann’s, which despite having exactly the sort of name you might find in a romantasy novel, is in fact a purveyor of mayonnaise and other table-top squirty condiments. Hellmann’s has teamed up with Armentrout and her publishers, Blue Box Press, to release a special edition of The Primal of Blood and Bone which is printed with ink mixed with their garlic aioli – the Craven being vampires, remember, and so averse to a bit of garlic. This is, of course, is an attempt to grab the TikTok generation by the throat. Understandably so: the video-sharing social media platform has become one of the biggest book marketing opportunities for publishers in modern times. And it is here, dear reader, that I heave a world-weary sigh and reveal myself to be yet another grumpy, middle-aged, largely unknown author waving his fist at the clouds in the style of Grampa Simpson and raging against the dying of the light … or at least, against the shift away from the seemingly outmoded idea of publishers just trying to sell books because, y’know, they’re books, and they’re good. Just hold off typing that takedown in the comment box for one second and let me explain. Do I sound bitter? Of course I’m bitter. All writers are misanthropic sociopaths at heart. We’re bitter about everything. That’s why we make stuff up all the time, trying to imagine worlds we might not be quite as bitter about as this one. But in this case, I’m not bitter at Armentrout – may her book fly, garlic aioli-infused edition or otherwise – or at other writers, or at any of my publishers. Rather, I’m bitter at a publishing industry model that seems weirdly averse to selling the majority of books it puts out. Of course, marketing budgets are limited at even the biggest publisher. There’s only so much money sloshing around. But there seems to be an odd system at work where the books that don’t actually need much promotion get all the money thrown at them. You know the ones I mean. The ones that zoom to the top of the charts on the day of release, the ones written by pop musicians or reality TV stars or Strictly judges or whoever, who get a nice spot on the BBC Breakfast or One Show sofa to plug them. The irony being that these are the books that don’t need marketing – they’ll essentially sell themselves. It’s all the other books written by, well, by people like me, who don’t get the benefit of big PR campaigns that really need this marketing push. If people don’t know about a book, they can’t buy it. There he goes again, being all bitter and shaking his fist. I am a realist, though; nobody wants to see Dave from Wigan awkwardly trying to flog his latest horror novel on the BBC Breakfast sofa between Taylor Swift and Kemi Badenoch when they can book erudite, entertaining and – most importantly – recognisable faces such as Richard Osman and Bob Mortimer and that lad from the boyband. However, a little anecdote from a Facebook authors’ group I’m in (Misanthropic Sociopath Writers, if you want to join): an author gave her publisher a list of press reviewers, booksellers, fellow authors and social media book influencers who said they would be happy to receive an advance copy of her forthcoming book. When several messaged her to say they hadn’t received a copy of the imminent publication, she checked with her publishers who sheepishly admitted they hadn’t sent any out. Which is why using gimmicks to sell books somewhat irks me. I have to admit, putting garlic in your ink is quite a topper wheeze, though it’s by no means the first time someone’s had this idea. Back in 1977, Marvel released a comic book about the flamboyant rock band Kiss, which was marketed as “printed in real KISS blood” after the band members did indeed add vials of their own blood to the red ink vat at the printers. But I wish these sorts of ideas would occur to publishers after they’ve fulfilled what seems to me to be one of their basic obligations: promoting – by the usual marketing means – all the books they have coming out. Otherwise, how will you, the reader, know about them? There’s also the danger of too much hype. Self-published author Audra Winter embarked upon a massive TikTok pre-release marketing campaign for her fantasy novel The Age of Scorpius. The anticipation reached fever pitch, with millions viewing her promotional videos and thousands placing pre-orders. Then when the book eventually came out earlier this year … people hated it. TikTok user and author LCGallagher posted a two-and-a-half minute takedown of the book with the words “a piece of shit with glitter on it is still a piece of shit”. On the book review site Goodreads, Age of Scorpius earned an average rating of 1.52 stars, with one user opining: “This is why when someone tells you your book isn’t ready, you don’t just dismiss it because it’s not something you want to hear.” And what had been a masterclass in TikTok marketing became an author’s nightmare as the platform’s users turned on Winter and her book. Still, it all does give me a bit of an idea. My next horror novel, out next year, is set in the coalfields of Lancashire. Most printing inks are carbon-based, aren’t they? So my book could be said to be “printed with real coal!” Now, can anyone do me a TikTok? David Barnett is the author of Withered Hill Withered Hill by David Barnett (Canelo, £9.99).

Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Bill Winters criticised banks that had jumped on the climate bandwagon when it was “fashionable”, but had since rolled back on their green ambitions or gone quiet on the subject. “Shame on them,” he said, without naming individual firms. His comments came weeks after HSBC became the first UK-headquartered bank to leave the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), in a further blow to international climate coordination efforts. The UN environment programme’s finance initiative, which is led by banks, commits members to aligning their lending, investment and capital markets activities with net zero emissions by 2050 or earlier. HSBC was one of the founding members of the NZBA, which was launched in 2021. At the time, Noel Quinn, the bank’s then chief executive, said industry-wide collaboration was “essential to monitoring progress” towards net zero. The decision to leave the initiative came months after HSBC revealed it would delay key parts of its climate goals for the next 20 years, and water down other environmental targets, as part of a long-term bonus plan for Quinn’s successor, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year. It also followed a wave of exits from the NZBA by big US banks including JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs during the run-up to Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. Trump’s second term has sparked a wide-ranging climate backlash from rightwing politicians, who have been emboldened by his anti-green push for higher oil and gas production. On Thursday, Winters said: “People that said a lot of stuff, but [when] it was fashionable to say it, [and] who are saying either nothing or the opposite now: shame on them.” He said most of Standard Chartered’s clients – from across China, India, wider Asia and the Middle East – were “as focused on their net zero transitions, or their transitions to low carbon economy, as they were before. And that obviously is good for business.” “A lot of these projects just make sense economically,” Winters added. “Most continue to honour the obligations that they made to their shareholders or other stakeholders early on, independent of political noise one way or the other.” During HSBC’s second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Elhedery said the decision to drop its NZBA membership was “not cost related”. He added that HSBC remained “fully committed in our ambition to become a net-zero bank by 2050” and was undertaking a review of interim targets for 2030, which would conclude in the second half of this year.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

Gas prices in Europe fell by almost a fifth between April and June this year after a sudden ceasefire forged between Iran and Israel eased fears that gas deliveries via the strait of Hormuz might be disrupted by conflict. The biggest weekly slump in gas prices in almost two years helped to dent Shell’s adjusted earnings for the second quarter, which fell by almost a third from last year to $4.26bn (£3.22bn). However, profits at Europe’s largest fossil fuel company were still higher than City forecasts, which had predicted a larger drop in profits to $3.7bn, allowing Shell to continue handing out bumper payouts to its shareholders. Shell attributed the profit drop to “lower trading and optimisation margins” as well as lower prices for oil and gas. In addition to the fall in European gas prices, Brent crude was trading below $68 a barrel at the end of the quarter, down sharply from more than $86 a barrel a year earlier. Despite the fall in profits and a rise in debt, Shell is continuing to pump money back to its investors through share buyback schemes. It announced it would spend $3.5bn buying back shares in the third quarter of the year. Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, said the company had delivered a strong operational performance in “a less favourable macro environment”. Gas prices were rocked by the Middle East conflict and were also weaker after a slump in Chinese energy demand amid fears that Donald Trump’s trade tariffs would hinder its economic growth. Lower demand for gas in China meant more shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the global market were available to European buyers, which helped to cool market prices. The weaker gas prices, although challenging for Shell, have meant lower bills for households. In the UK, the government’s energy price cap fell by 7% from July and was expected to remain at a similar level from September, according to forecasts. Sawan told CNBC: “The tricky thing was, it was non-fundamentals-based volatility. And what I mean by that is this wasn’t fundamental changes to supply demand balances. This was not a change to physical commodity flows. This was really sort of paper-induced volatility, and that is not what we typically trade into.” Derren Nathan, the head of equity research at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said a recent rise in oil prices should help Shell’s financial performance improve in the third quarter of the year. “Shell’s second-quarter earnings hit a bit of an oil patch, with lower commodity prices, a weaker trading environment and unplanned downtime at its chemical plants all playing their part,” he said. Shell’s profits continue to anger environmental campaigners, after the company last year rolled back decarbonisation targets. Robin Wells, the director of Fossil Free London, a campaign group that protested outside Shell’s headquarters on Wednesday night, said: “We are now in a new normal of record-breaking heat, created by corporations like Shell. This will mean devastation and mass loss of human life. Climate scientists have warned us that this new normal will spell the end of human civilisation by 2100. It’s time for destruction to stop raising billions in profit.”", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever", "Shell"]}

Hein Schumacher, who joined the owner of Marmite, Domestos and Dove in June last year, took home €3.9m for his first six months as chief executive. He earned a €1.86m annual bonus on top of his €1.4m in basic pay and benefits, which included €292,492 to help cover his relocation to the UK, according to Unilever’s annual report published on Thursday. He was also awarded €648,000 in compensation for long-term bonuses that would have been earned at his previous employer the Dutch dairy co-operative FrieslandCampina. Schumacher could have earned more. Along with Unilever’s other executives, the group’s compensation committee decided to lower his annual bonus to 115% of salary, down from to 150%, which it should have been after achieving set targets announced last year. Andrea Jung, the chair of the compensation committee, said it had made the change because while “performance delivered in the year was strong, we believe there is scope to improve our competitiveness”. She said the committee had concluded the group was “not winning sufficient market share in a number of key markets” and the share price performance was below expectations. The change was “reasonable and aligns the experience of shareholders stakeholders and the executive directors”, it said. Unilever’s former chief executive Alan Jope and Schumacher earned a combined total of €6.07m last year. In the year ahead, Schumacher’s fixed annual salary will remain at €1.85m. Unilever promised to keep that figure steady for two years after almost 60% of shareholders voted to reject its remuneration report last year. However, Schumacher can earn up to €8.5m for hitting basic targets, which are not disclosed, and more than double that if he achieves maximum targets and raises the company’s share price by 50% from the date his bonus shares are granted. That figure includes an annual bonus worth 225% of his salary – nearly €4.2m – if he hits maximum targets that include undisclosed targets for underlying sales growth and increases in underlying operating profit. He could also collect a further 400% of salary – €7.4m – under a three-year incentive plan that includes targets on return on capital and sustainability as well as sales growth. Jung said the targets had been tweaked from last year after discussions with shareholders. “Having undertaken an extensive consultation exercise before finalising the new remuneration policy, the committee believes it can be fully supported by the great majority of our shareholders,” she said.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

Walmsley, 56, who has run the FTSE 100 company since 2017, will step down from the board at the end of this year, and remain at GSK until her notice period ends on 30 September 2026. It is unclear what she will do then, but she said she had no intention of retiring. Luke Miels, GSK’s chief commercial officer whom she brought in from rival AstraZeneca in 2017 and described as a “dream appointment” in her diary, will replace her and starts on 1 January. Walmsley, who joined the company from L’Oréal in 2010 and ran its consumer healthcare business before being promoted to the top job, pushed through a shake-up of the group, including the 2022 spin-off of its consumer arm, now called Haleon, with brands such as Sensodyne, Panadol and Advil – its biggest corporate restructure in two decades. GSK’s pipeline of new drugs has lagged behind rivals but she slimmed it down to focus on the “real winners” and sharpened its focus on respiratory, immunology, inflammation and cancer medicines, as well as vaccines. She ramped up spending on research and development to £6.4bn last year, including £1.5bn in the UK. Walmsley said: “2026 is a pivotal year for GSK to define its path for the decade ahead, and I believe the right moment for new leadership. Miels, an Australian who has a degree in biology and worked for Roche and Sanofi-Aventis in the US, Europe and Asia in the past, had been touted as an eventual successor. Walmsley came under intense pressure in 2021 from the activist investor Elliott Management, a US hedge fund, which criticised years of underperformance of the drugmaker and her lack of scientific background, and demanded that she reapply for her job. However, she successfully fended off pressure from Elliott, and GSK later rebuffed takeover offers for its consumer healthcare arm from Dove maker Unilever, valuing it at £50bn. One of Britain’s best-known businesswomen, Walmsley joined the prime minister’s business council in mid-2023 under Rishi Sunak and recently attended the state banquet at Windsor Castle during Donald Trump’s visit to the UK. She is one of the highest-paid chief executives in the UK, with a £10.6m total package last year including a £1.6m salary, down from £12.7m in 2023 as a result of lower bonuses. The company said in February that she could get a maximum package of £21.6m this year that would partly pay out in three years’ time, in an attempt to offer US-style pay packets to top executives. She has been paid almost £66m during her years at the helm. Miels will receive a lower salary of £1.38m, and is in line for a total package of up to £16.6m including long-time share bonuses. Walmsley’s departure will leave the FTSE 100 with just seven female chief executives: Milena Mondini de Focatiis at Admiral, Amanda Blanc at Aviva, Allison Kirkby at BT, Stella David at Entain, Liv Garfield at Severn Trent, Louise Beardmore at United Utilities and Margherita Della Valle at Vodafone. The GSK chair, Sir Jonathan Symonds, thanked Walmsley for her “outstanding leadership in delivering a strategic transformation of GSK, including the successful demerger of Haleon” and said the business had a “bright and ambitious future”. GSK expects to launch 15 blockbuster medicines between now and 2031, taking annual revenues to more than £40bn, from £31bn at present. However, the share price performance has been lacklustre, as investors worry about patents expiring in its HIV business. The company also has no presence in the fast-growing anti-obesity market. “The new CEO appointment is likely to shift sentiment positively,” said analysts at Bank of America. “Miels has a strong pharma focus at a time where business is shifting to speciality drivers.” Walmsley’s departure comes at a difficult time in the pharmaceutical industry, as Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs this week on branded drugs. Drugmakers are also locked in a row with the UK government over pricing of new medicines, and other companies – AstraZeneca along with MSD and Eli Lilly of the US – have either paused or scrapped important investments in the UK. GSK has stressed its commitment to the UK, while also announcing new investment in manufacturing and research in the US two weeks ago.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Unilever may be overstating how green certain products are through the use of “vague and broad” claims, unclear statements about recyclability, and natural-looking images and logos such as green leaves. Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, said: “Essentials like detergent, kitchen spray, and toiletries are the kinds of items you put in your supermarket basket every time you shop. More and more people are trying to do their bit to help protect the environment, but we’re worried many are being misled by so-called ‘green’ products that aren’t what they seem. “So far, the evidence we’ve seen has raised concerns about how Unilever presents certain products as environmentally friendly. We’ll be drilling down into these claims to see if they measure up. If we find they’re greenwashing, we’ll take action to make sure shoppers are protected.” It could ask for undertakings from Unilever that commit the firm to change the way it operates; take the company to court; or close the case without further action. The regulator is concerned that some claims by Unilever – which is also behind the Cif, Dove, Comfort, and Lynx brands – that focus on a single aspect of a product may suggest it is environmentally friendly as a whole; that claims about some ingredients may exaggerate how natural the product is; and that its use of colours and imagery, such as green leaves, create the impression that some products are greener than they actually are. Under its former chief executive Paul Polman, who stepped down in 2019, Unilever positioned itself as a global leader on sustainability. But the company is on track to sell 53bn non-reusable sachets containing anything from sauces to shampoo this year, breaking its commitment to switch away from single-use plastic, according to a recent report from Greenpeace. It said Unilever is set to miss its pledge to halve its use of virgin plastic by 2025 by nearly a decade. The Changing Markets Foundation, a US-based campaign group, found last year that Unilever had replaced recyclable PET bottles of washing liquid with pouches as part of its push to encourage refills. The pouches were not recyclable and contained only two refills. Unilever said it would continue to cooperate with the CMA, but said it was “surprised and disappointed” with the CMA’s announcement and denied that Unilever’s claims “are in any way misleading”. It said: “Unilever is committed to making responsible claims about the benefits of our products on our packs and to these being transparent and clear, and we have robust processes in place to make sure any claims can be substantiated.” Unilever said it used the on-pack recycling label to provide consumers with information on how to dispose of its packaging after use, and noted that the company was a founding signatory of the UK Plastics Pact, which brings together the entire plastics packaging chain to tackle the challenges around plastic waste. Greenpeace said the investigation “must be a wake-up call for Unilever”. Nina Schrank, the head of plastics at Greenpeace UK, said: “People have bought into Unilever’s claims of sustainability in good faith, expecting those claims to be more than just smoke and mirrors. The truth is Unilever isn’t living up to that promise, and they never will until the company takes real action to tackle issues like the ruinously huge amounts of single-use plastic they produce. That means committing to phasing out single-use plastic, starting with an end to the billions of highly polluting sachets they’re selling globally each year.” The CMA inquiry forms part of its wider investigation into greenwashing, after it expanded its work on environmental claims to include consumer goods in January – essential items that are used on a daily basis, such as food and drink, cleaning products, toiletries and personal care items. Last year, shoppers paid more than £140bn for these fast-moving consumer goods. The wider investigation has also examined claims by Asos, Boohoo and Asda’s George brand about the eco-friendly status of their fashion products. The CMA’s initial review uncovered a range of concerning practices, prompting it to launch a formal investigation into Unilever on Tuesday. Since it published its compliance review, some suppliers have amended or removed some green claims, but its work is continuing and investigations into other companies may follow.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

The intervention by Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris agreement when she was the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change, comes before discussions about Australia’s commitment, due to be announced next month. Cabinet is yet to receive formal advice from the Climate Change Authority, chaired by the former NSW Liberal treasurer Matt Kean. A decision on the target is expected before Anthony Albanese attends the UN general assembly in New York in late September. A consultation paper by the authority last year – based on an initial assessment of scientific, economic, technological and social evidence – suggested a 2035 target of between 65% and 75% below 2005 levels “would be ambitious and could be achievable if additional action is taken by governments, business, investors and households”. Since then, the government has been lobbied about what target it should set. Figueres said setting a target of a 75% or more reduction would be “not a burden”, but instead be “Australia’s ticket into the prosperity of the future”. She suggested the ambitious goal would increase Australia’s chance to win the rights to host a major UN climate summit in Adelaide in November 2026. Australia continues to vie with Turkey for the right to host the Cop31 summit and it is unclear when that will be resolved under the UN’s consensus decision-making process. “The new global economy is rising, powered by clean energy and green industry,” Figueres said. Australia can be at its heart, with unrivalled sun and wind, critical minerals and skilled labour ready to lead. “Prime minister Albanese now has the chance to show the Pacific and the world that Australia is ready to lead at Cop31 and beyond.” Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter A report last week, commissioned by the Business for 75% group, which is backed by Future Group, Fortescue, Atlassian, Canva, Ikea and Unilever, suggested a 75% reduction target could lead to national GDP being $370bn greater by 2035 compared with current projections. It said the economic benefits of the more ambitious goal would be much greater than under a 65% target. A separate report to be released on Monday by the research thinktank Climate Analytics suggests Australia should set a reduction target of about 81%, within a range of 76% to 89%, to align with the Paris agreement goal of attempting to limit global heating since preindustrial times to 1.5C. The Climate Analytics chief executive and senior scientist, Bill Hare, agreed with Figueres that other countries would be watching where Australia landed as they considered the government’s case that it should co-host Cop31 with Pacific Island countries. Hare said multiple studies had found Australia could “get into the 75% range in terms of what is technically and economically feasible”. He said significant cost-effective emissions cuts were possible in several areas, and the main barriers to action were political. Some organisations lobbying the government have focused on an advisory opinion by the international court of justice that found countries had an obligation to take measures consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5C. They have argued it meant Australia should set a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2035 – a goal that many experts say it would not be logistically possible to meet. Frank Jotzo, the director of the Australian National University’s Centre for Climate and Energy Policy and a government adviser on climate policy, said that even a reduction target in the 60s would be ambitious. He said the government should be ambitious but the policies to drive change were more important than the number. Jotzo said Australia’s emissions reductions had been slow to date, and reaching a 65% reduction goal would require pollution levels to be halved in a decade. That was possible, he said, but would require substantial policies in areas where emissions have been rising or going sideways – particularly industry, transport and agriculture – and faster reductions than were happening in electricity. “Whatever target gets adopted should have a path to implementation and should have a good chance of being perceived as possible,” he said. Jotzo backed a suggestion by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, that the government may set a target range, rather than a single number.", "section": "Environment", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

The global consumer goods group has committed to reducing its plastic footprint and has said it wants to create a “waste-free world”. Under its former chief executive Paul Polman, who stepped down in 2019, Unilever positioned itself as a global leader on sustainability. Four years ago, the company’s outgoing head of nutrition, Hanneke Faber, described the type of multilayer plastic found in sachets as “evil” because it could not be recycled. However, research by the environment NGO Greenpeace has found that despite Unilever’s pledge to halve its use of virgin plastic by 2025, the company is on track to miss the target by nearly a decade. Nina Schrank, the head of plastics at Greenpeace UK, said: “Unilever really are pouring fuel on the fire of the plastic pollution crisis. Their brands like Dove are famous for telling the world they’re forces for good. But they’re pumping out a staggering amount of plastic waste. It’s poisoning our planet. You can’t claim to be a ‘purposeful’ company whilst bearing responsibility for such huge pollution. Unilever has to change.” The throwaway sachets of consumer products such as condiments, beauty and health products are marketed and sold in large quantities to the global south. Unilever says this is because “in several of our markets, plastic sachets allow low-income consumers an opportunity to buy small amounts of products – often ones that provide hygiene or nutrition benefits like shampoo, toothpaste and food – which they would otherwise not be able to afford”. The sachets, however, are also linked to pollution on land and in waterways, resulting in, for example, clogged drains, worsened flooding and threats to wildlife. Sachets produced by the Unilever brand Dove have been found polluting beaches and other waterways in the Philippines and Indonesia. Dove produced an estimated 6.4bn sachets in 2022. Greenpeace is urging Unilever to phase out single-use plastic in the next decade and begin by stopping the use of sachets. Greenpeace is also calling on Unilever to back a global plastics treaty the NGO says must include a legally binding target of cutting plastic production by at least 75% by 2040, based on a 2019 baseline, followed by a phase-down in the production. Marian Ledesma, a campaigner at Greenpeace Philippines, said: “Each one of the many Dove sachets we found polluting beaches and waterways should be a badge of shame for Dove and Unilever. They can’t continue to flood countries like the Philippines with waste they know can be devastating … Each sachet represents the enormous health risks, environmental degradation, social injustices and climate impacts caused by plastic production and the plastic life cycle. “If Unilever want to be seen as a leader, they should stop being part of the problem. They have to show they’re serious and commit to phasing out single-use plastic, starting with sachets. And as treaty talks continue they must turn their influence on the world stage towards helping push for this level of ambition to sit at the heart of a strong global plastics treaty.” A Unilever spokesperson said that tackling plastic pollution is a top priority for the company which is still making progress across all its plastic goals. The company is a member of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, which is campaigning for an ambitious, legally binding UN plastic treaty. “In the past few years, we have rapidly increased our use of recycled plastic (PCR) in our global portfolio to 21%. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation recently called out Unilever as one of the businesses making the most progress to reduce its virgin plastic packaging footprint. “We’re working on a range of solutions to reduce our use of plastic sachets, which are difficult to recycle, and replace them with alternatives. This is a complex technical challenge, with no quick fixes, and we are fully committed to working with industry partners and other stakeholders to develop viable, scalable alternatives that reduce plastic waste.”", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

Companies are free to choose where to advertise", "date": null, "author": "Nils Pratley", "publication": "The Guardian", "text": "It is less than a year since Elon Musk told advertisers who were shunning his social media site, X, that they could take their business elsewhere permanently. In fact, he encouraged them to do so. “Don’t advertise,” he said, amid a backlash over his endorsement of an antisemitic tweet. “If someone’s going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself.” The instruction had the virtue of clarity. Everybody knew where they stood. Advertisers who took the view that X has become a poisonous sewer under Musk’s ownership – or even just those who merely regarded the site as the wrong place to promote soap and suchlike – could seek other venues. And X would thrive or fail without them. Now Musk has had a change of heart. X has launched a lawsuit in Texas claiming it is the victim of an “illegal boycott” by advertisers. Unilever and Mars, the consumer goods groups, Danish windfarm operator Ørsted, and American healthcare group CVS Health are the targets, alongside a body called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (Garm). The companies, supposedly, withheld “billions of dollars in advertising revenue” from X in a malicious conspiracy that violated US antitrust law. It is probably unwise to predict what a US court may decide, but this case deserves to be thrown out for being ridiculous. “No small group of people should be able to monopolise what gets monetised,” argued X’s chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, as if companies should be compelled – by who? – to advertise on certain media outlets. Come on, you’re running a profit-seeking business, like most of the rest of the media world. If you can’t make the revenues stack up, that’s your problem. If anyone is guilty of showing monopolistic tendencies here, it is X in believing it deserves to be protected from everyday commercial pressures. To see how advertisers think in practice, read the testimony from Herrish Patel, president of Unilever USA, who explained in detail to a US House of Representatives committee last month how the company allocates its advertising dollars. Unilever was stung by an early case on Facebook of ads for its Dove soap being placed adjacent to posts glorifying rape and domestic violence. The company drew the understandable lesson that it wanted to deal with “responsible” platforms that took more care. “Similarly, the Unilever brands that are trusted and appeal broadly to all Americans are not served by content that is divisive or politically polarising,” Patel wrote. In 2020 – long before Musk bought Twitter, as it was then– Unilever “pulled back” from social media advertising. These days, he said, only 20% of the company’s advertising goes on social media platforms, and less than 1% to digital news. The bulk of the digital spend is directed at the websites of Amazon, Walmart and Target and so on for the boring reason that shoppers there are close to making buying decisions. That is not a conspiracy; it is an advertiser assessing its commercial interest. The House judiciary committee somehow swallowed the Musk-friendly line that members of Garm were engaged in antitrust behaviour, but it’s hard to see how that conclusion fits the facts. Garm is mostly concerned with allowing companies to know where their digital advertising appears. The choice of where to spend remains with the company. “Unilever, and Unilever alone, controls our advertising spending,” said Patel – a statement that, again, should be entirely unremarkable. There really isn’t a mystery about why X’s revenues may be falling. Trust levels with advertisers are low, and the likes of Amazon deliver a bigger bang for the same buck. You can see the same process in the UK, where big supermarket chains are investing heavily in “retail media” and sharing data insights from their online operations with brand companies. X is being outcompeted on the advertising front. The company could try helping itself by investing in content moderators. But it’s all competition in action. Even if X, miraculously, were to win its attention-seeking lawsuit, advertisers will still form their own views on where they get the best returns and where they have “brand safety”, as they put it. A “free speech absolutist”, you’d think, would understand that.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

Cutting emissions The target was initially promised by February, but postponed until after the May election while the government waited on advice from the Climate Change Authority, a government agency chaired by former NSW Liberal treasurer Matt Kean. Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter The government is expected to announce the target at the same time it releases a barrage of reports, including the Climate Change Authority’s target advice, a plan to reach net zero by 2050 and an analysis of what can be done to cut pollution in six sectors of the economy, including electricity and energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land, resources and the built environment. New policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be announced alongside the new goal, which would build on the government’s 2030 target of a 43% reduction below 2005 levels. Views differ on whether the government is on track to meet that goal, but the projections released in November suggest the country is headed for a 42.6% cut – just shy of the legislated target. Setting targets The 2035 target matters not just in Australia, but internationally. It will be submitted to the UN as part of the country’s “nationally determined contribution”, or NDC – what the government says it can do to help the world meet goals in the 2015 Paris agreement. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has indicated Australia is likely to submit a range rather than a single number. The Paris deal includes a commitment that the target must be more ambitious than the existing 2030 goal – there can be no backsliding – and reflect the country’s “highest possible ambition”. The Climate Change Authority released a consultation paper in April 2024 with its preliminary assessment, finding a cut of at least 65% and up to 75% “would be ambitious and could be achievable if additional action is taken by governments, business, investors and households”. Since then, the authority has been consulting experts and interest groups and has undertaken modelling to refine its advice. Its board – including scientists and business figures – reached its final position last week and Bowen received the advice on Friday. The authority is required to consider what the best scientific advice says Australia should be doing to keep alive the goal of trying to limit global heating to 1.5C since preindustrial times. It should also consider the international political and diplomatic landscape, the economics of what’s possible, the pace of technological development and what is considered socially deliverable. From a scientific view, analyses have found Australia should make a percentage cut of somewhere between the high 70s and 100% – actually reaching net zero – by 2035. Australia’s Pacific island neighbours have also stressed the need for their more developed friend to be as ambitious as possible – and to stop approving new fossil fuel developments. Some of these analyses – including by the thinktank Climate Analytics and the Australian Conservation Foundation – have detailed estimates of how cuts could be made to meet a target of at least 75%. Climate campaigners generally believe the target range must include 75% to be credible. But other experts, such as Frank Jotzo, the director of the Australian National University’s Centre for Climate and Energy Policy, have argued that even a target of 65% would be ambitious, given it would require pollution to be cut in half over the next decade and progress to date has been much slower. He said the introduction and implementation of policies to transform the economy was more important than the number. Business organisations are politically influential and vary markedly in their positions. One group of about 500 that includes Fortescue, Atlassian, Ikea and Unilever has argued strongly for 75%. Others have emphasised the cost of action and pitched for a goal in the 50s. The Business Council of Australia issued a veiled warning about setting a target in the 60s or 70s, publishing modelling suggesting between $395bn and $530bn of capital investment would be needed. International action The picture across developed countries is mixed. The US (a little more than 10% of global emissions) has abandoned the field on climate action. The UK has a 2035 goal equivalent to a 78% cut when compared with 2005 levels, and the EU is expected to land in the high 60s or low 70s. But Japan, Canada and New Zealand have set much lower targets (equivalent to 59%, 45-50% and 51-55% below 2005 levels respectively). As an emerging economy, China – the world’s biggest national polluter – has not yet set targets on the scale of those nations that developed earlier. Its current goal is that its pollution will peak by 2030. Some analyses suggest that might have already happened as it builds extraordinary amounts of renewable energy and uses less coal power (even as it continues to build new plants). There is a focus before the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil in November on what Beijing will promise to do by 2035. In an interview, Bowen pointed to a 2021 calculation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that suggested global emissions needed to be cut by 60% between 2019 and 2035 to keep the 1.5C goal on the table. That translates to a 68% cut below 2005 levels – the baseline used by Australia. Global heating has accelerated since that report was released and 68% is a planet-wide average, suggesting developed countries such as Australia would need to do more to be aligned with the 1.5C goal. The climate risk The problem that was trying to be addressed was spelt out in detail on Monday in the first national climate risk assessment, released by Bowen and developed by the Australian Climate Service. It modelled the impact of climate-related hazards such as heatwaves, drought and floods on different parts of the community, economy and environment under three global heating scenarios: above 1.5C, above 2C and above 3C. Modelling found under the 1.5C scenario alone the annual direct cost could of floods, bushfires, storms and cyclones could reach $40bn by 2050. The assessment found deaths from heatwaves – the deadliest form of extreme weather event – could rise significant under higher temperatures and sea level rise meant more than 1.5 million people could be living in areas at risk of coastal flooding in 2050. Financial systems, supply chains, infrastructure, primary industries and national security could all face substantial disruption. On the natural environment, it reinforced that Australia was likely to lose ecosystems and species by the middle of the century and this could affect people’s access to clean air, water and food. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the findings would inform the 2035 target while also stressed the need to plan for an “orderly” transition to avoid losing public support for climate action.", "section": "Environment", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

Israel began its long-threatened ground offensive in Gaza City on Tuesday, sending tanks and remote-controlled armoured cars packed with explosives into its streets, in defiance of international criticism and a UN commission of inquiry’s finding that it was committing genocide in the Palestinian territory. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the goals of the offensive were “defeating the enemy and evacuating the population”, omitting any mention of the freeing of the remaining Israeli hostages, which had been a constantly stated war aim until now. Hostage families and their supporters protested near Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence on Tuesday, accusing him of abandoning their loved ones. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said it was clear that Israel had no interest in a peaceful outcome.

The charges filed against Robinson include aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm and witness tampering. Why have prosecutors said they will pursue the death penalty? Gray said the aggravating circumstances were the 31-year-old Kirk’s “political expression” and the fact that children were present to witness the killing.

If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, please bring it on. Over to you,” Patel said during his opening statement to the Senate judiciary committee. The hearing featured several angry exchanges with Democrats and lasted more than four and a half hours. California’s Adam Schiff pressed the director on why Ghislaine Maxwell had been transferred to a lower-security federal prison after speaking with a top justice department official in July. Patel said he was not involved in the decision. What did he say about Jeffrey Epstein?

For any serious debate to be had, we urgently need to recognise that that the military budget is already larger in real terms than in 1980 – during the height of the Cold War. The British armed forces are presently deployed in the Middle East, Indo-Pacific and Europe. Rather than rethinking these commitments, ramping up spending further has been taken as given.

BP is preparing for a showdown with activist hedge fund Elliott Investment Management by going back to its roots. Ahead of a keenly anticipated investor day on Wednesday, Iraq’s state news agency said the oil major, once known as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, had signed a deal to redevelop four of the gulf state’s Kirkuk oil and gas fields over 100 years after it first began drilling for oil in the region. The deal has emerged as BP’s board prepares to present a “fundamental reset” of the company’s struggling strategy to defend the company against Elliot which has recently amassed a stake worth almost £3.8bn, or 5% of its shares. Elliott Management is widely expected to use its grip on the 120-year-old company to demand sweeping changes, including a potential break-up of the company, after BP lost almost a quarter of its market value in the past two years. Under the terms of the deal BP is expected to spend up to $25bn over the lifetime of the project, a senior Iraqi oil official told Reuters in early February. The signing came after the two parties agreed on “technical issues and contractual terms, including the economic model of the project,” according to a statement published by the state news agency. The deal also marks a breakthrough for Iraq, where output has been held back by years of war, corruption and sectarian tensions. Time to wrap up…. Bitcoin has hit its lowest level since last November, as the crypto surge following Donald Trump’s election last year loses momentum. Bitcoin is down over 6% today at around $88,000, while ether has slumped 10%.

Sales of new Tesla cars almost halved in Europe last month, indicating waning demand for the US carmaker’s vehicles as its chief executive Elon Musk intervened repeatedly in the politics on both sides of the Atlantic. The Texas-based carmaker sold 9,945 vehicles in Europe in January, down 45% from last year’s 18,161, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). Tesla’s share of the market dropped to 1% from 1.8%. Shares in UK defence companies have jumped after Sir Keir Starmer announced plans to increase defence spending to at least 2.5% of GDP by 2027. BAE Systems, which makes armoured vehicles, warships, attack submarines, missile launchers, artillery systems and munitions, are up 4.2%. Babcock, which supplies engineering support to naval, land, air and nuclear operations, are up 1.5%. The average energy bill for households in Great Britain will rise by £111 from April to £1,849 a year for a typical household, after the energy regulator announced the third consecutive increase in the cap on gas and electricity charges.

Shares in MicroStrategy, which has issued billions of dollars of debt to buy bitcoin, are down 8.5% in early trading…. Over on Wall Street, shares in Tesla have dropped 1.5% at the start of trading. Tom Bailey, head of research at HANetf, cautions that Keir Starmer’s pledge to achieve 2.5% of GDP defence spending by 2027 is unlikely to be enough to fortify Europe. Bailey explains: The Trump administration has demanded 5%, while Mark Rutte, the current head of NATO, has said spending will have to go much higher than 3%. “The figure also remains well below Cold War era spending (as a share of GDP). In 1989, the UK spent 4.2% of its GDP on defence, while in the early 1970s it spent an average of 5.1%. This, we should remember, was a time when the U.S. commitment to European security was rock solid. In our current era of heightened geopolitical instability, combined with the potential of U.S. disengagement, the UK and other European NATO members will have to be much more ambitious. “The current increase in defence spending will continue to benefit UK defence stocks, Bailey predicts, adding: The news saw a lift to BAE Systems’ share price, now up over 4% today at time of writing. Babcock and QinetiQ also saw gains on the back of the news. Over in the US, house price growth has picked up a little. Prices rose by 3.9% in the year to December, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price index, up from a 3.7% annual gain in November. A narrower survey of 20 large US cities showed that house price inflation rose to 4.5%, up from 4.3%. New York again reported the highest annual gain among the 20 cities with a 7.2% increase in December, followed by Chicago and Boston with annual increases of 6.6% and 6.3%, respectively. Tampa posted the lowest return, falling 1.1%. Cutting foreign aid (to fund higher defence spending) will weakens the UK in an unstable world, warns the IPPR think tank. Harry Quilter-Pinner, executive director at IPPR, explains: “The government is right to act decisively to increase defence spending – the world has changed radically even in the last week. Some on the left will find this difficult to accept, but there is nothing progressive about leaving the UK or Europe under-defended. Any government’s first duty is to keep its citizens safe and secure. “But to navigate this era of global insecurity the UK will need new partnerships and alliances, and cutting the aid budget will undercut our ability to build them. When the UK helps countries to adjust to climate change, to grow and to prosper, we build our relationships and our influence. When countries like the UK withdraw, China and Russia stand ready to step in. The US is making a strategic mistake in dismantling USAID: the UK should not fall into the same trap. “With defence spending set to rise beyond 2.5 per cent, and other pressures on public services growing, further spending cuts will not be a viable strategy in the future. The world has changed since Labour took office. Going forward, the government should re-consider whether its commitments on spending and tax are fit for the future.” Here’s City analyst Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, on the defence stock rally: Ben Zaranko, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says Keir Starmer is right to resist funding higher defence spending through higher borrowing: “If the UK needs to spend more on defence on a structural and permanent basis, that is not something that can be sustainably borrowed for. The Prime Minister has recognised this, and has signalled that higher defence spending will be offset, at least in the short term, by lower spending on overseas aid. If defence spending needs to go higher than 2.5% of GDP, cuts to aid won’t be enough. Getting towards 3% of GDP will eventually mean more tough choices and sacrifices elsewhere - whether higher taxes, or cuts to other bits of government. The world has changed, and one question is whether the government’s pre-existing promises on tax and spend might need to change as well. Zaranko adds: As a minor note to what is a major announcement, the Prime Minister followed in the steps of the last government by announcing a misleadingly large figure for the “extra” defence spending this announcement entails. An extra 0.2% of GDP is around £6 billion, and this is the size of the cut to the aid budget. Yet he trumpeted a £13 billion increase in defence spending. It’s hard to be certain without more detail from the Treasury, but this figure only seems to make sense if one thinks the defence budget would otherwise have been frozen in cash terms. This is of course dwarfed by the significance of today’s announcement but is frustrating none the less.” Crypto markets are “anything but quiet”, says David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, following the drop in bitcoin to around $88,000 today. Morrison says: Yesterday Bitcoin slumped below intermediate support around $95,000, and this morning it sliced through longer-term support at $91,000. Bitcoin has lost around 10% since the end of last week and is trading at its lowest level in over three months. Ether is down 16% since Sunday’s close, and other cryptos are also getting hit. The move looks like a broad ‘risk off’ trade, triggered by last week’s $1.5 billion hack of the Bybit exchange. Keir Starmer’s defence spending pledge has not hurt UK government bonds. Gilt prices are a little higher today, pulling down the yield (or interest rate) on short and long-term UK debt slightly. That’s because Starmer was clear to MPs that the money to hit the 2.5% of GDP target will come from the overseas development budget, not from increased borrowing. Shares in UK defence company BAE Systems have climbed, after Sir Keir Starmer told MPs that the UK government will lift defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. BAE Systems are now up 4.2%, the top riser on the FTSE 100 index, as Starmer confirmed earlier rumours that he would boost spending, and also set a “clear ambition” to get defence spending to 3% in the next parliament. Traders will be calculating that some of the £13.4bn of extra spending pledged each year from 2027 by Starmer (funded by cutting the aid budget) will be spent buying BAE products, which include armoured vehicles, warships, attack submarines, missile launchers, artillery systems and munitions. So far this year, BAE’s shares have risen by over 17%, as pressure has mounted on European governments to spend more on defence. Other European defence company stocks are also rallying today – Germany’s Thyssenkgrupp has jumped by over 11%, following reports that Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz has opened talks with the Social Democrats to quickly approve as much as €200bn in special defense spending. Shares in defence company BAE Systems are rising, following the news that Sir Keir Starmer is to give a surprise statement to MPs at 12.30pm on “defence and security”. My colleague Andrew Sparrow writes: We have not been told what he will be announcing, but a ministerial statement by the prime minister is normally big news, and there is speculation that he might have something significant to say about defence spending ahead of his meeting with President Trump in the White House on Thursday. The government has a theoretical commitment to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, but it has not said when this will happen, or even if it will be before the next election. Until recently ministers have been saying that the decision will be announced when the strategic defence review is published in the spring. But Starmer is going to want to arrive in Washington with some news that will impress Trump, and the one thing the US president gets most praise from in Europe is being right about the need for Nato countries to spend more on defence. Starmer may be addressing that today. There’s a rumour that Starmer may slash the UK aid budget to fund higher spending on defence…. BAE Systems are up 3.2% today, adding to their recent gains on expectations of higher European defence spending. Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, reckons two factors are responsible for the drop in crypto prices: “The crypto market has gotten off to a tough start in 2025. We believe there are two material factors contributing to this. The first comes down to what has already been priced in. Indeed, there has been plenty of optimism around a crypto-friendly US administration. At the same time, a lot of this optimism has already been reflected in the price action from November through January, leaving the market exposed to a sell-the-fact type reaction. Investors are now looking for more follow-through on the administration’s policies, which should act as a catalyst for the next wave of demand. “The other drag comes from the world of traditional markets where risk appetite has cooled off in response to global trade tension and a more hawkish Fed outlook. As far as this goes, we believe correlations between bitcoin and traditional risk assets can be misleading, with bitcoin easily capable of generating sizable demand as an attractive portfolio diversification asset given properties that align more with that of a store of value. Technically speaking, there is formidable support for bitcoin in the $70-$75k area, which should serve as an attractive higher low ahead of the next major upside extension and bullish continuation to a fresh record high beyond $110k.” Over in parliament, the boss of South West Water’s owner Pennon has said she has “regret” for the pollution incidents caused by the utilities firm. Chief executive Susan Davy told the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee: “I absolutely regret and do not condone those incidents and pollutions that we had. “We do not want to harm the environment, that is not the activities that we undertake everyday. “We have hundreds of treatment works and thousands of pumping stations and from time to time things do go wrong.” She said there were 194 individual pollution incidents across the group between 2023 and 2024. Pennon was fined £2.2 million in 2023 for illegal sewage spills spanning four years across Devon and Cornwall. South West Water was also hit by a cryptosporidium outbreak in Brixham, Devon last year, which forced thousands of households and businesses to boil their tap water before drinking it. Davy received a pay increase of £300,000, weeks later. UK environment secretary Steve Reed is now being booed as he answers questions about inheritance tax at the National Farmers’ Union conference, Joanna adds: Back in London, Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), has railed against what he called the government’s “cruel” changes to inheritance tax for agricultural properties in his opening address to the organisation’s annual conference. Bradshaw also warned that a cashflow crisis is leading farmers to question whether they can keep going until the end of the year, my colleague Joanna Partridge reports. The government’s inheritance tax changes, announced in October’s budget, are “morally wrong and economically flawed”, Bradshaw told delegates, as he vowed to keep trying to get the policy changed: He said: “We will not go away and we cannot go away, we will not give in until ministers do the right thing.”. Bradshaw said he had received “hundreds” of letters from NFU members worried about the impact of the tax changes on elderly farmers who were expecting to pass down the family farm when they die. He said: “I think of the grandson who wrote to me about their 94-year-old grandfather.” “This isn’t just money, this is blood, sweat and tears. The farm is their life’s work, but as they grow older, the farm has also become their pension, because that’s what they were told to do. Tax changes are only part of the challenges facing the nation’s farmers, Bradshaw said, listing “bad policy, geopolitics and unprecedented weather” as other pressures, which had left some sectors of UK farming “in the worst cash flow crisis ever”. He added: “Many farmers genuinely worry about whether they will make it to the end of 2025.” Bradshaw criticised chancellor Rachel Reeves for refusing to meet him to discuss the tax changes, joking that he might have a better chance of arranging to see her “in Davos” at the World Economic Forum. Bradshaw’s speech was followed by environment secretary Steve Reed. Acknowledging the difficult reception he has received at other farming events, Bradshaw said it would have easiest for Reed not to attend. Farmers silently held up a protest banner during Reed’s speech, asking “How high up your ‘pecking order’ is eating?”. Demonstrating the strength of feeling among some farmers, several tractors parked outside the QEII conference centre in Westminster honked their horns during his speech. The value of major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are tumbling this morning, as anxiety over the US economy fuels volatility in the financial markets. Bitcoin has dropped by roughly 8% in the last 24 hours to around $88,000, its lowest level since mid-November last year. That means the world’s largest crypto coin has lost around 6% off its value since the start of 2025, having fallen back from record highs of $109,000 late last year. Ether, the currency for the ethereum network, is also falling, down 10% in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency world is reeling from the biggest digital theft in history, in which $1.5bn of ether was stolen from Dubai-based crypto platform Bybit. Today’s selloff also comes amid rising volatility in the markets; shares on Wall Street fell on Friday and Monday, on concerns that the US economy may be slowing. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says high volatility is weighing on crypto: Bitcoin is sharply lower and is below $90,000, which is a sign that the current environment of rising volatility is not conducive to cryptocurrency gains. The gold price, which has risen to fresh record highs in recent days, slipped early on Tuesday, however, it is clawing back earlier losses now that Europe has opened. The low for the day is $2929, but if risk sentiment continues to falter, we expect the gold price to continue to recover in the short term. After Donald Trump won the US election last November there was speculation that the US would take a more pro-crypto approach, and possibly create a bitcoin strategic reserve. Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, says: Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2025, Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline, dropping over 13% from $106,000 to $92,000. Trump was supposed to be a good luck for crypto but now it appears that things are totally opposite. We do also think that this downturn is attributed to geopolitical concerns, economic uncertainties, and unpredictable policy shifts under the new. administration. Additionally, a significant security breach involving the Bybit crypto exchange, resulting in a $1.5 billion theft primarily in Ethereum, has further dampened market sentiment. UK households face mor expensive airline tickets, as well as higher energy bills, this summer. Budget airline Ryanair’s CEO predicted this morning that summer fares will rise by between 4% and 6%. Michael O’Leary told a press conference in Warsaw: “Fares will grow between 4% and 6% this year, so you’ll still be traveling at slightly cheaper prices than in the summer of 2023, but you’ll be a little bit up on 2024”. O’Leary also predicted that Boeing will catch up on its delivery backlog in time for summer 2026. Annd he suggested that Ryanair could have up to five million passengers in Ukraine within a year or two of the country’s skies being opened after a ceasefire is agreed. Automotive analyst Matthias Schmidt said one factor behind Tesla’s sales decline in Germany could be that consumers were waiting for the upgraded Y model, scheduled for the first half of 2025, the Financial Times reports. However, other experts have also blamed a backlash against Musk’s political involvement, they add. Elsewhere in Europe, we have confirmation this morning that Germany’s economy contracted at the end of last year. German GDP contracted by 0.2% in October-December, statistics body Destatis says, confirming an earlier estimate. Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says: “The GDP data were reported as expected – weak, as anticipated. The continued decline in investments, particularly in the equipment sector, combined with the significantly lower export figures, could point to structural weaknesses that may hamper the German economy’s ability to recover in the coming quarters. Despite the negative GDP growth, the increase in selected service sectors and the slightly higher number of working hours indicate that some positive dynamics are emerging in certain segments, which could serve as a catalyst for a future upswing.” Bloomberg have calculated that Tesla’s sales within Europe slumped to a two-year low in January. They explain: Tesla registered only 1,277 new cars last month in Germany, its lowest monthly total since July 2021. Sales in France plummeted 63% in its worst showing there since August 2022. The company also registered fewer vehicles than China’s BYD Co. for the first time ever in the UK. Tesla’s sales slumped almost 8% in an EV market that grew 42% last month. Sales of Tesla cars across Europe almost halved in January, new data shows, perhaps a sign of a consumer backlash against Elon Musk. Just 9,945 Teslas were sold across the European Union, the UK and the EFTA region last month, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) has reported,. That’s a 45% plunge compared with the 18,161 Teslas sold in January 2024. Despite the slump in demand for Teslas, sales of new battery-electric cars grew by 34% to 124,341 units, capturing a 15% market share. The overall market shrank by 2.1%. Many of the EU’s major markets saw declines, with France (-6.2%), Italy (-5.8%), and Germany (-2.8%). Spain conversely recorded a 5.3% increase. There have been signs in recent weeks that Musk’s backing of Donald Trump, and his interference in other country’s politics, may be hurting Tesla, one of the companies he runs. At the start of January, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, accused the world’s richest man of intervening directly in the continent’s democratic processes. Last month, protesters gathered outside Tesla dealerships across the US in response to Musk’s efforts to shred government spending through the ‘department of government efficency’ (DOGE). Musk’s move to the right also saw him back Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party in January, ahead of last weekend’s election. He also claimed that UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer was “complicit in the rape of Britain”, in a row over grooming gangs. The surprise exit of Hein Schumacher will not go down well with investors, explains Chris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot: “Losing a chief executive after 18 months is never a good thing. For Unilever, especially during a strategy turnaround, it does not suggest things were going well behind the scenes or the business was firing on all cylinders. The last set of results suggested that turnaround had stalled somewhat, with weak guidance and sales growth only likely to improve as the company passes on higher commodity costs. “Evidence of quick operational improvements are needed when you are embarking on a new strategy, and with new management. The change at the top of Unilever will not see a change in that strategy, which is positive, and guidance has been reiterated. However, the new CEO, current chief financial officer Fernando Fernandez, will have been pivotal in agreeing and implementing that strategy and ultimately is the best the company could do for now. He is well liked and respected and is unlikely to rock the boat, but clearly, as recent results show, work still needs to be done to bring back that momentum. “Unilever has a long way to go on its road to recovery. The share price offers a bit of headroom to do that, but events such as this will not go down well with investors. Results will be watched even more closely now to ensure there are no signs of cracks within that turnaround strategy.” Here’s our news story about the rise in the energy price cap: The FT are reporting that Unilever’s board decided to oust CEO Hein Schumacher at a board meeting yesterday, having decided that finance director Fernando Fernandez was “better suited” to execute the company’s turnaround plan. Shares in Unilever have dropped 2% at the start of trading in London, as investors react to the surprise departure of CEO Hein Schumacher announced this morning. Chris Venables, director of politics at Green Alliance, says: “Energy bills are once again being pushed up because of the UK’s exposure to the global price of gas. The only way to lower energy costs for people is to insulate leaky homes and rapidly scale up homegrown renewables. We urge the government to ensure its Warm Homes Plan and the upcoming spending review properly allocate funding to these measures. It must ignore the siren calls of denial and delay.” Consumer champion Martin Lewis is urging households to fix their energy bills now, to avoid the increase in bills in April. He explains that the cheapest fixed deals available on the market are around 4% cheaper than the current price cap – even before the rise 6.4% announced this morning. Posting on X, Lewis explains: HOW TO KNOW IF YOU’RE ON A CAPPED TARIFF If you’re not on a fix or special deal you are likely on the Cap. It applies to firms standard default consumer tariffs, often called ‘Standard Variable’ or ‘Flexible’ tariffs. If you don’t know assume you, like two third of homes probably are. THE PRICE CAP IS A PANTS CAP GET OFF IT IF YOU CAN - FIX NOW IF YOU HAVEN’T ALREADY The cheapest year-long standalone fixes right now are about 4% LESS than the current Cap, never mind once it rises in April, so if you get a good fix now you lock in at a cheaper rate for a year, get price certainty, save instantly and save relatively more once we get to April. Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme now, Lewis says he’s hearing that “some good tariffs” are being launched this morning – so consumers should wait until lunchtime for making comparisons. Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, reports that energy arrears are now the second most common debt they help people with, behind only credit cards. April’s jump in the price cap will probably make this worse. Steve Vaid, chief executive at the Money Advice Trust, says: “This latest price rise will only add to the challenges many people face in keeping up with their bills. “Ofgem must press ahead with their plans for a Help to Repay scheme, to bring energy debt down, while the Government must urgently bring in targeted bill support through an energy social tariff. “Anyone struggling with their energy bills, or worried about their finances, should contact a free debt advice charity, like National Debtline.” Several UK charities are warning that this morning’s rise in the energy price cap (which covers England, Wales and Scotland) will hurt struggling householdss The Centre for Ageing Better is concerned that millions of older people already struggling on low incomes will be put into even greater difficulty with increasing energy costs, having already lost their winter fuel payments last year. Millie Brown, Senior Evidence Manager for Homes at the Centre for Ageing Better, says: “It is so dispiriting to learn that bill payers must brace for another substantial increase to energy prices from April. For those living on the breadline, desperately struggling to meet the basic costs of everyday living, this will be heartbreaking news. There are millions of older people who no longer qualify for winter fuel payments who live on paltry incomes that do not even cover the basics of a dignified life. They simply will not be able to afford higher energy prices and will cut back usage further, at significant risk to their own health. If the government, industry regulators and energy providers can’t stop this seemingly inexorable rise in the cost of energy, then we urgently need to see more support offered to help reduce people’s energy usage. Home improvement services are vital to improving homes for millions of people, we need adequately funded, comprehensive support for people to maintain, repair and adapt their homes across the country. By acting now to ensure that everyone has the same access to a national network of one-stop shops for home improvement, we can ensure that safe, suitable, and energy-efficient homes are not a privilege but a basic right for all.” Independent Age chief executive, Joanna Elson CBE, is urging the government to widen elibility for the Winter Fuel Payment, which it means-tested last summer: “Today’s price cap announcement is more bad news for the older people in poverty that have already been subjected to a brutally long and cold winter. We now know that energy prices will rise again by 6%, from an average of £1,738 to £1,849. People in later life on low fixed incomes have stretched their budgets to breaking point during the colder months, and many tell us they don’t have enough money to turn the heating on full stop. Now, their bills rise yet again to amounts they simply cannot afford. “History cannot be allowed to repeat itself next winter. The UK Government needs to put in place plans that support older people in financial hardship to turn their heating on. Since the changes to Winter Fuel Payment were made in July, our helpline has seen a massive increase in calls regarding the payment, and many of the people we have spoken to have made drastic cutbacks, such as only living in one room and cutting down on food. Far too many older people on low incomes don’t receive Pension Credit and are now falling through the cracks – in the short term, the UK Government should urgently review and widen the financial threshold of the Winter Fuel Payment. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, reports that the number of people living in a household in debt to their energy supplier has reached a new high of nearly seven million. “We’re particularly concerned about households with children, where over one in three struggle to afford bills, rising to more than half of those on low incomes. “The government can’t let another winter go by without targeted support for those most in need, and there is a way of paying for this. Our recent analysis found energy network companies made billions in excess profits while households have faced soaring bills, and it’s only right this money be used to help fund better targeted bill support and much-needed debt relief.” Consultancy Cornwall Insight suggests that the energy price may ‘dip slightly’ in July. But that would only shave a few pounds off average annual bills, rather than being a meaningful drop. Dr Craig Lowrey, Principal Consultant at Cornwall Insight, explains: “There is a sense of déjà vu in the energy market as we watch the price cap rise for a third consecutive time, with the volatile international wholesale market once again the main culprit. Households have been promised falls in bills, and many will be understandably irritated with what they may see as a failure of government energy policy. However, the reality is, our gas-led wholesale power market and reliance on international imports limits the impact of what any government policy can have - at least in the short-term - there is only so much you can do when prices are rising across the world. “That’s not to say the government and the regulator are without options to help lower consumer bills. Ofgem has ongoing consultations looking at the non-wholesale costs included in the cap, and of course the government has levers it can pull from social tariffs to support payments. We are also seeing initial considerations on structural changes to the cap, with Ofgem’s consultation on a zero standing charge variant announced last week. However, many would argue all of this is merely tinkering with what is - at least for bill payers - a fundamentally broken system. Newsflash: Consumer goods maker Unilever has surprised the City by announcing the departure of its CEO, Hein Schumacher. Schumacher is leaving Unilever, which owns Marmite, Dove and Ben &amp; Jerry’s, having only taken control of the company 19 months ago, in July 2023. Unilever says he is departing “by mutual agreement” and will leave the company on 31 May 2025. He is being replaced by Unilever’s chief financial officer, Fernando Fernandez. Schumacher had been implementing a “growth action plan”, and Unilever’s board indicaate they want Fernandez to accelerate it – a hint that Schumacher wasn’t making changes quickly enough? Unilever chairman Ian Meakins explains: “On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Hein for resetting Unilever’s strategy, for the focus and discipline he has brought to the company and for the solid financial progress delivered during 2024. Hein introduced and led a significant productivity programme and the commencement of the Ice Cream separation, both of which are fully on track. The Growth Action Plan (GAP) has put Unilever on a path to higher performance and the Board is committed to accelerating its execution. We are grateful for Hein’s leadership, and we wish him the very best for the future.” Meakins adds that “while the Board is pleased with Unilever’s performance in 2024, there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results”…. Last year, Unilever announced it would cut 7,500 jobs through a cost-saving programme. The UK government is considering giving more support to households with their energy bills. It is proposing expanding the £150 Warm Home Discount scheme, so that nearly three million more families would be eligible This would mean one in five families in Britain would get help with their bills through these proposals Announcing a consultation on the idea, energy Secretary Ed Miliband says: “This Government is determined to do everything we can to protect people from the grip of fossil fuel markets. Expanding the Warm Home Discount can help protect millions of families from rising energy bills, offering support to consumers across the country. “This is a Government that will always stand up for working people. “Alongside this, the way to deliver energy security and bring down bills for good is to deliver our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower- with homegrown clean power that we in Britain control.” The government is also planning to accelerate a debt relief scheme which it says will help tackle debt and reduce households’ energy costs. Jonathan Brearley, CEO of Ofgem, has blamed “volatile” prices in the wholesale energy sector for pushing up the price cap on British energy bills. Brearley says: “We know that no price rise is ever welcome, and that the cost of energy remains a huge challenge for many households. “But our reliance on international gas markets leads to volatile wholesale prices, and continues to drive up bills, which is why it’s more important than ever that we’re driving forward investment in a cleaner, homegrown system. The jump in the energy bills in April will force more families to ration energy, warns National Energy Action, the fuel poverty charity. It has released a new poll showing that 49% of adults in Britain expect to ration their energy in the coming months. The NEA’s chief executive Adam Scorer says: ‘For the third time in a row the price cap is rising. Households already faced sky-high bills as a result of the energy crisis, and today’s announcement will add to the burden on the most vulnerable. We already see the impacts of sustained high bills – total energy debt is at record levels and rising, and people are rationing their heating to dangerous levels and going without essentials. ‘National Energy Action is calling for additional targeted energy bill support through a social tariff or an expanded Warm Home Discount; a help-to-repay scheme to support households out of debt; and for the government’s Warm Homes Plan to provide significant investment to insulate the coldest homes for the poorest households.’ Here’s more details of April’s rise in the energy price cap just announced, from Ofgem. Electricity rates If you are on a standard variable tariff (default tariff) and pay for your electricity by Direct Debit, you will pay on average 27.03 pence per kilowatt hour (kWh). The daily standing charge is 53.80 pence per day. This is based on the average across England, Scotland and Wales and includes VAT. Gas rates If you are on a standard variable tariff (default tariff) and pay for your gas by Direct Debit, you will pay on average 6.99 pence per kilowatt hour (kWh). The daily standing charge is 32.67 pence per day. This is based on the average across England, Scotland and Wales and includes VAT. Why energy prices have gone up Rising global wholesale prices for energy are the main reason for the increase. Some people may see a reduction in their standing charges, but this will depend on the region in which they live. Newsflash: The energy price cap on bills across Great Britain will rise by 6.4% in April, regulator Ofgem has announced. This will lift the average annual cost of electricity and gas for a typical household to £1,849 per year, up from £1,738. This is the third consecutive hike in the cap on gas and electricity charges, and a little higher than analysts had expected. Here are the details, just released by Ofgem: [Reminder: the cap limits the amount which a supplier can charge for a unit of electricity or gas]. The expected increase in energy bills in April will help to push the cost of the global energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to £3,000 for the average British household by the summer. The average annual bill in Great Britain under the latest energy price cap is forecast to be about £750 higher than in the pre-invasion winter of 2020-21, a 75% increase, according to calculations by the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, a campaign group. The cumulative toll of the price increases in the last four years comes to £3,033, the group said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s cost of living squeeze could tighten today when households if energy bills will rise again this spring. Ofgem, the energy regulator, is due to announce the latest price cap on the cost of a unit of energy at 7am, and analysts expect the cap to go up, due to recent increases in wholesale gas and electricity prices. Consultancy Cornwall Insight have crunched the data, and estimate the quarterly cap will rise by 5%. That would increase the typical annual household energy bill about £85 to £1,823 per year – it’s currently £1,738 per year. The government is concerned about the risk of rising energy bills pushing up inflation. Last week, a Whitehall source told the Guardian they expected bills in England, Scotland and Wales to increase by about £9 a month over the next three months in another challenge to government plans to tackle the cost of living. Thie prompted energy secretary Ed Miliband to write an urgent letter to Ofgem, saying the price rise means the energy regulator must move faster to protect consumers. The energy price cap sets the maximum that a supplier can charge for a unit of energy (there’s no cap on how high a bill can go).

Ideally it would be a Cybertruck but any Tesla would do. Then I could plaster it with those “I bought this before Elon went mad” stickers, shamefacedly sell it at a loss and write a performative social media post about no longer being able to stomach the guilt of driving it around town. But as I don’t actually own a car, let alone a Tesla, I’ve felt unable to add my voice to the anti-Musk and anti-Trump protests gaining momentum around the world. Until now. Of course, I will not be travelling to the US at any time soon. As former US secretary of labor Robert Reich writes, why reward Trump’s America with my tourist dollars? But as I wasn’t planning to visit America, this doesn’t feel like a sacrifice, let alone a meaningful one. So the appearance of the #BoycottUSA movement has arrived at just the right time. Here is a campaign I can sign up to wholeheartedly. But I plan to go further than the one in three French people who are merely “avoiding” American products. Instead, I am proposing a total purge, ridding my house and my life of any taint of Americana. Not a Marlboro will be smoked, no Manhattan drunk, no foot stomped to the exuberant refrain of Cotton Eye Joe. These are, of course, mere gestures. Eschewing Marlboros and line-dancing is no sacrifice at all, though turning down a perfect Manhattan will be tough. I know that if I am going to be serious about de-Americanising everything, I have to get systematic about it. There will need to be research and auditing, rules and considerations and caveats and, above all, self-control, commitment and discipline. So, to keep myself on this righteous path and to help others similarly appalled by America’s descent into authoritarian plutocracy cleanse their lives of Yankee fare, I offer the rules of the game and an incomplete review of everything that I will be replacing with un-American alternatives. * * * The rules 1 No American product may be bought or American service used. No exceptions. (But what about Apple, I hear you say. They have rejected calls to remove DEI policies! What about Patagonia? They are the good guys! Yes, and yes, of course some American companies – and some Americans – are good. But “whataboutery” won’t get us anywhere.) 2 If an American product has been previously bought, it can be used until it breaks, at which point it cannot be replaced by another American product. (Note: if a working product, eg an iPhone, uses American services, eg iCloud storage, it must be immediately replaced by a product that does not require American services to work.) Similarly, one is allowed to keep any existing American friends, but making new American friends is verboten. 3 If an artist (a writer, musician, film-maker, actor, whatever) is American, their work is taboo. It is acceptable to experience American art on existing physical formats but, as per Rule 2, these cannot be replaced once defunct. (To support American artists is to support the American Military-Media-Entertainment Complex. Sorry, Bruce.) 4 It’s not a principle if it doesn’t cost you something. * * * So, now that we are clear about the rules, it’s time to apply them, starting with the trickiest area of all: technology. You might imagine me to be a typical metropolitan media douche, swanning around coffee shops with my bestickered MacBook Air while using my Apple Watch to pay for my £4.30 flat whites. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. I actually swan around coffee shops with an unstickered Google Chromebook and I use a Garmin running watch to pay for my £4.50 pour over, thank you very much. But whether you are an Apple fanatic or a Google diehard, replacing hardware and software is going to be painful, costly and complicated, and will involve unfamiliar systems with steep learning curves. It is possible to replace US hardware with Chinese or Taiwanese equivalents but as these come with their own moral issues, I’ve forced myself to look for European devices, which makes for a harder, but more self-congratulatory journey. Just imagine how smug it will feel to have mastered a whole new operating system on a European laptop and to send an inaugural text message on a sustainable European phone! So, I will be replacing my Google Pixelbook Go with a German Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 running its own version of the Linux (developed at the University of Helsinki) operating system. My Google Pixel 8a Android phone is going to be swapped out with a Franco-Dutch Murena Fairphone 5 running the “deGoogled” /e/OS and my American Garmin will be replaced by a Finnish Suunto watch. But even avoiding US tech brands does not guarantee that a phone or laptop will be completely un-American. Fairphone uses soldering paste made out of recycled tin (good!) made for them by Connecticut-based MacDermid Alpha (bad!). And their phone chips are made in Asia by US-based Qualcomm. Tuxedo does not specify where its components come from, though it says that the vast majority are made in Asia and imported to Germany where its laptops are assembled. Surprisingly, it turns out that phones and laptops are complex devices with many, many, many components and also the global supply chain is very complicated indeed. Don’t lift the rock if you’re squeamish about what you might find underneath. With hardware mostly sorted, it’s time to get familiar with open source software, as I won’t be able to use the vast majority of apps that come with Apple or Android devices. No more Gmail, Google Maps or Apple Photos. Instead, I’ll be switching to Proton Mail (based in Switzerland, home of lots of privacy-focused apps), OpenStreetMap (or UK-based Citymapper for urbanites) and Immich, a photo library that I’ll be hosting myself instead of paying Apple or Google for the privilege. Video calling with Zoom and Google Meet can be supplanted by Norwegian Whereby, while word processing, spreadsheets and presentations will all be handled by LibreOffice, part of the non-profit Berlin-based Document Foundation. Au revoir Microsoft Teams, you will not be missed. As anyone who has tried to switch from Android to iPhone or Mac to PC knows, familiarity is a major barrier to change. Abandoning tools and services I’ve used for years (decades, in the case of Gmail) and learning new systems, new terminology and new shortcuts is tedious, expensive and frustrating. I’ve always thought of myself as “good at the internet”, but trying to work out how to get public transport directions in OpenStreetMap or make a LibreOffice document look as if it has been designed by somebody with working eyes is making me feel tired and old. When it comes to social media, things get really tricky. I obviously deleted my X/Twitter account long ago but, according to Rule 1, I will have to delete my Bluesky profile and turn to its nerdier cousin Mastodon. Hey, at least I won’t stumble across Piers Morgan there. And a smaller, less shouty social network that doesn’t demand much attention reduces the risk of making any new American friends or contacts (Rule 2). I’m sure there are plenty of good, well-meaning Americans out there sharing good and interesting insights, reckonings, gifs and feelings, so please don’t think I’m being rude if I block, mute or ignore you until 2028. I’m just following the rules. YouTube is, I fear, fairly irreplaceable. I could up my TikTok usage (it’s Chinese-owned) but as the point of this whole exercise is to make me a better person, will that really work? I’ve tried Dailymotion (the French YouTube) and it simply doesn’t scratch that itch. There’s just so much less of it. If your hope is that a French YouTube will be infused with subtle yet sophisticated Gallic charm, then I am going to have to disappoint you. Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+ and Prime Video will all have to go. Arrivederci The Studio, Reacher and Slow Horses. Hasta luego Seinfeld repeats, Breaking Bad binges and The Good Place water cooler moments. But thankfully we still have the Great British Broadcasting Corporation and its tip-top iPlayer service. I haven’t watched EastEnders since the early 1990s. I’ll bet there’s been plenty going on in Albert Square for me to catch up on. And for music I have Spotify, which is Swedish, so already not American. But remember, no streaming of American music – we don’t want royalties falling into the wrong hands. On Spotify you can block artists so they don’t appear in your recommendations. Setting up this block list will be the cultural self-flagellation that demonstrates total devotion to the cause. Never again will I groove around the kitchen to Marvin, Aretha or Otis. Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, time to saddle up and ride into the sunset. No, Alexa, do not play Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar from Spotify. This one’s going to hurt. And then there’s Amazon. Finding alternatives to “the world’s most customer-centric company” is a non-negotiable. While Waterstones has a US investment group as its majority shareholder, there are plenty of other places that will post a book to you including uk.bookshop.org, which gives a significant proportion of its profits to local independent booksellers. Non-book items will require more shopping around, more patience and will probably come at a higher cost, but at least I’ll be sleeping with a clear conscience while I wait. Next up is a room-by-room property inspection to see where further American invaders can be eradicated. The kitchen is a battlefield as a small number of giant US food conglomerates own a great many European brands, all of which must now be purged from fridges and cupboards. Is there anything more English than Gary Lineker flogging a salt and vinegar crisp? Think again, for Walkers is owned by Frito-Lay, itself owned by PepsiCo. No Wotsit, Quaver, Frazzle or Monster Munch (sob!) shall pass my lips again. The list of prohibited foods is lengthy and surprising, and it will be necessary to get familiar with all the brands owned and managed by Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Mondeléz to ensure that no proscribed product accidentally gets into the shopping trolley. It’s going to be easiest to print out a list of these products (only a dozen or so pages in 9pt type) to take to the supermarket on every shop. And printouts have the benefit of being able to be waved aggressively at anyone I spot reaching for the Alvalle Gazpacho (made in Spain, owned by PepsiCo) in Waitrose. In the cupboard under the sink and in the bathroom, I thought it would simply be a question of replacing anything from Procter &amp; Gamble with the equivalent item from Anglo-Dutch Unilever. Begone Ariel, Oral B and Olay. Wilkommen Persil, Signal and Dove. But as Unilever owns a huge number of US brands, again it becomes a question of a forensic inspection of the labels and an encyclopedic knowledge of American corporate hierarchies. I might have to follow the example of my French mother-in-law who makes her own washing liquid by blending Savon de Marseille, warm water and bicarbonate of soda. I don’t think this is a political gesture, though with the French you can never be sure. For my part, I will be washing only in the finest Eau de Thames Water followed by a quick spritz of Unilever-owned Brut. As someone who hasn’t worn a pair of Levi’s since Nick Kamen left the scene, a boycott of American clothing is barely a challenge. According to Rule 2, I can wear my Converse All Stars until they fall apart, at which point they will be replaced by German Pumas or Italian Diadoras. Zara (Spanish) and Uniqlo (Japanese) will dress me from head to toe, though strangely most men’s underpants brands do seem to be American. Thank God for Marks &amp; Spencer. Then, just as I light a Gauloise to celebrate the complete decontamination of my life, I come across three issues that make me let out a Homer Simpson-esque “Doh!” in frustration. First, it is not possible to find a bank that doesn’t use either Visa or Mastercard to process payments and every time a payment is processed, one of these two US businesses gets a cut. Stockholm-based Klarna might be a non-US option for some online payments and there is talk of the European Central Bank issuing “digital euros” later this decade, but I doubt I’ll be able to take advantage of it here in Brexity Blighty. So, short of keeping wads of notes stashed in the mattress and shopping only in stores that still take cash, there doesn’t seem any practical way of deAmericanising this particular aspect of modern life. And in further fiscal frustration, if your pension plan is anything like mine, it is likely to hold a mixture of investments including UK, European and US stocks. I asked the very sensible person who administers my pension whether I could get rid of my US investments and was told it is possible, “although probably rather unwise as divesting completely from US holdings reduces geographic diversification, which could impact risk-adjusted returns”. I suspect in this context “rather unwise” actually means “Does this idiot even understand how money works?” Call me a coward, but incurring the wrath of my wife by jeopardising her future financial security is too great a risk for me to contemplate. And then I was reminded of something that has made me doubt whether I can do any of this at all. Because Arsenal – the football team I support and read about and think about and care about a little too much – are, like nine other Premier League clubs, American-owned. And not just any American, but shopping mall developer, married-to-Walmart-heiress all-American American. Dang! Even if the nearest British-owned team were not our hated rivals Tottenham, I just can’t switch allegiance. I’m going to have to give up football itself. But not now, not yet, not with the excitement of a European quarter-final so fresh in the memory. Sorry. So, yeah, I’m keeping my bank account, my pension, my football team (for now) and, I hope, my marriage. This exercise is not about rejecting the modern world or the pleasures and comforts of modern life. It’s about turning away from America and turning towards Europe. One day I’d love to go back to the States and eat a cheeseburger in a Brooklyn dive bar, toasting old friends and new with shots of rail bourbon in the Land of the Free. But not for the time being, not under the current regime. So pour me a Rob Roy, give me a packet of Marmite-flavoured peanuts and sit me down in front of Antiques Roadshow, I’ll be grand. Up on the moral high ground life is sweet, if a little lonely. See, my family refuse to close their WhatsApp accounts and join me on Telegram and I think they might be talking about me behind my back. I get lost all the time and no one is liking or sharing the photos I post to Pixelfed. And I really miss my friends and our group chats, miss the videos and in-jokes and playlists we share, the things that have nourished our relationships over the years. But it’s OK. It’s not a principle if it doesn’t cost you something.", "section": "Life and style", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

Unilever said the shift away from home working and expansion in Latin America had helped offset heavy competition from expensive new brands in the US such as Native and Dr Squatch. Graeme Pitkethly, the group’s finance director, said: “Many people didn’t use deodorant as much when they were in lockdown and working from home and some recovery in that is coming through.” The recovery in deodorant sales helped Unilever’s personal care division outperform the rest of its product categories in Europe making it the only one to increase the amount of items sold. The total volume of products sold by Unilever in the continent slumped 10%, which the consumer goods company compensated for with a 13% increase in prices – rises that have prompted accusations of profiteering and so-called greedflation. Sales of ice cream, such as Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Magnums, were hit by the cool, wet summer and competition from supermarket own-label items as Unilever increased prices. Worldwide, Unilever, which owns a vast array of brands from Marmite to Domestos, said total underlying sales rose 5.2% to €15.2bn (£13.2bn), led by price rises of 5.8%, while the number of items sold dipped 0.6%. However, Hein Schumacher, the chief executive of Unilever, said the company had not increased its profit margins as it had not passed on all its cost increases to its customers. Schumacher, who joined Unilever in July amid shareholder dissatisfaction with the pace of growth after a failed pursuit of GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products division, said the pace of inflation was “continuing to moderate” but suggested there could be more to come. He said Unilever was seeking to “drive simplicity and productivity”, a process which could include some factory closures, although no such plans have been finalised, and “some more pruning” of non-core brands. On Thursday the company said it was selling a majority stake in its Dollar Shave Club razor brand, which it bought for about $1bn in 2016. The company intends to focus investment on its top 30 biggest brands – those worth €1bn or rapidly heading in that direction, including Dove, as it seeks faster growth. Meanwhile, Unilever’s much-vaunted sustainability efforts are to be streamlined to focus on four areas: climate, nature, plastics and livelihoods. Its aim is to bring in more near-term goals, where progress can be clearly seen. Schumacher said Unilever’s brands that had a clear social or environmental purpose-led strategy, such as Dove, would continue to develop that but the group would not “force-fit” purpose on to all its brands. Unilever has faced criticism over its ongoing presence in Russia, where its business continues to sell locally manufactured “essential” products, from shampoo to ice-cream, after evidence emerged that it paid Moscow $331m in taxes last year. The company has also admitted that it will comply with a local law which allows conscription of Unilever’s 3,000-strong workforce in Russia across its four manufacturing sites and head office. Schumacher said: “I understand why there are calls to leave the country.” He reiterated that he would continue to review the situation and said the business had taken action to “minimise Unilever’s economic contribution to the Russian state” and would “continue to watch the situation closely and review our options”.", "section": "Business", "query": "Unilever", "companies": ["Unilever"]}

In front of a partisan full house at the Estadio Uno in La Plata, an hour’s drive south of Buenos Aires, the century maker displayed his customary calm to steer the tourists through troubled waters early on. England were reduced to 13 when losing two players to the sin-bin before half-time, yet somehow made it to the interval ahead thanks to Ford’s drop goal. From there they were the only team in the contest. In a remarkable transformation Steve Borthwick’s team bagged four second-half tries, three in seven minutes between the 42nd and 49th minute. Tom Roebuck claimed two tries and Freddie Steward added a third, before Cadan Murley came off the bench to seal the deal late on. “It is all about the team, as always,” said Ford, deflecting praise away from his own milestone achievement. “We understand how difficult it is here in Argentina so it is a great win for us. We were under pressure in the first half; we gave away too many penalties and could not get out of our half. We had to make sure second half we got out of our half and create some try-scoring opportunities, which we did. “We have to back it up next week and we know Argentina will come back at us. Another challenge that we will look forward to.” Ford came into the game inspired by messages from Frank Lampard, John Terry and the former prime minister Tony Blair, a fly-half during his school days at Fettes College. The trio sent video tributes, along with adventurer Bear Grylls, and cricket stars Freddie Flintoff and Joe Root. He, himself, insisted it was “just another day at the office” but it did not feel that way as Alex Coles and Seb Atkinson were sent to the sin-bin repelling Argentina’s early charge. The match could easily have got away from England at that stage given they were blooding three new caps in Atkinson, Will Muir and Guy Pepper. Instead Borthwick’s charges displayed a steely resolve. Time and again Argentina were held up over the try line, first by the prop Joe Heyes, then a combined effort of Jamie George, Tom Willis and Atkinson, then again by George and Sam Underhill. There were shades of the 2023 World Cup meeting of the nations in Marseille where England had Tom Curry sent off after three minutes but outworked the South Americans to claim a famous victory on the back of Ford’s 27-point masterclass. It was perhaps no coincidence the Sale fly-half, who had kicked a first half hat-trick of drop goals that night in France, landed one here to get England into this contest. It allowed them to lead at half-time, from where they took the game away from their hosts in hugely impressive fashion. Within two minutes Roebuck had his first, put over in the corner by Ford and Steward. Five minutes later Ford was at it again, zinging a pass to Steward for the second. Before the Pumas could get their head round what was happening, Roebuck helped himself to his second from a Heyes pass. Stung into a response, Argentina finally found a cutting edge. Pablo Matera pulled a try back, from Santiago Carreras’s cross kick, and soon after Pedro Rubiolo added a second. A fortnight ago an England team very similar to this blew a 12-point lead to lose to France at Twickenham in the final five minutes of their non-cap international. For a moment it seemed the Pumas had the wind in their sails and could inflict further damage. But Ford stepped up, put a calm hand on the tiller and guided England away from danger. Two penalties, the conversion of Murley’s late try, and the match was won. It is only half-time in the series but given Borthwick had billed Argentina as “heavy favourites”, this was a statement win of which England can feel rightly proud.", "section": "Sport", "query": "Ford", "companies": ["Ford"]}

What do I get out of it?” an exasperated Francis Ford Coppola asks Shia LaBeouf on the set of Megalopolis. “I don’t get money. I don’t get fame; I already have fame. I don’t get Oscars, I already have Oscars. What do I get that I want?” LaBeouf eventually gives up. “Fun!” Coppola says. “I wanna have fun!” Making Megalopolis doesn’t look like most people’s idea of fun as Coppola attempts to corral actors, crew, costumes, locations, lavish sets and special effects all in service of a sprawling sci-fi-meets-ancient-Rome story that no one fully understands. Throw in the fact that the film-maker spent $120m of his own money on the passion project by selling off part of his winemaking business to raise funds, having spent nearly 50 years trying to get it made, and that the production was beset with delays, technical headaches and bust-ups, and you feel this is more than most 83-year-olds should have to go through. But watching Coppola making Megalopolis often is rather fun – perhaps more fun than the end product, to be honest. Just as the documentary Hearts of Darkness captured the chaos and strife behind the making of Coppola’s legendary Apocalypse Now back in 1976, so Mike Figgis’s new film Megadoc takes us on to the set of Coppola’s latest, grandest adventure. If we don’t quite get heart attacks and typhoons this time round, we do get as raw and intimate a portrait of an auteur at work as we’ve had for some time. That’s partly down to the nature of the project and the personalities behind it – but it is also a testament to Figgis’s skill as an intuitive, self-effacing, and observant film-maker. “I have a huge problem with the way documentaries are shot now; they’re shot like bad B-movies,” says Figgis, just before Megadoc’s premiere at the Venice film festival. “I know from my own experience that in order to get funding for a documentary, you have to kind of submit a script, which seems to me the antithesis of what a documentary should be; it should be a journey of discovery.” Figgis says he has known Coppola for decades. They first met in the 1990s, after he cast Nicolas Cage – Coppola’s nephew – in his hit movie Leaving Las Vegas. When he heard Coppola was about to start work on Megalopolis at last, Figgis wrote to congratulate him. “Almost as a little afterthought, a bit of a joke, I said: ‘If you need a fly on the wall, just let me know.’” A few months later, he recalls, Coppola called him out of the blue saying: “‘When could you be here? Do you have a visa? Can you come now?’ It’s a very Francis thing.” Days later, in November 2022, with a small crew and his smallest camera, Figgis arrived in Atlanta where Coppola and his cast were just getting started on rehearsals. “When I first turned up, I wasn’t introduced, so nobody knew who I was.” As well as seeing Coppola at work, Figgis’s film is a window on to his actors, including Adam Driver, Aubrey Plaza, Jon Voight, Dustin Hoffman, Giancarlo Esposito and Laurence Fishburne. We get to see them in and out of role, interacting with Coppola, with each other and with Figgis. Driver keeps his distance, Plaza is mischievous and playful, but it’s LaBoeuf that Figgis zeroes in on as good material. Where most of the cast respect and trust Coppola and go along with his wishes and whims, LaBoeuf “was the one actor that really – very bravely, actually – challenged the process on many, many levels”, says Figgis. LaBoeuf, a notoriously volatile figure, persistently questions Coppola’s direction, his character’s backstory, his blocking, even his own performance (“some of these takes are just trash”). LaBoeuf also confesses he is terrified of getting fired, mindful that Coppola famously replaced Harvey Keitel with Martin Sheen a month into shooting Apocalypse Now. He survives, and there’s even affection between the two men, but by the end Coppola is so exasperated with him he throws up his hands and walks off the set, saying: “If you don’t need me tonight, I’m happy to go home.” As Figgis readily admits, “all the really good docs about film-making have been stories about disasters, so every time something negative happened I was thinking: ‘Oh, that’s good for the documentary.’” Fortunately for Figgis, if not for Coppola, there were more crises on the horizon. The production almost collapses halfway through when Coppola fires the visual effects supervisor, Mark Russell, and half the art department leave with him. At its heart, the split was perhaps a clash of two incompatible styles of film-making: the art department were accustomed to working on big, state-of-the-art effects movies, such as Marvel films, which require a lot of planning and collaboration (and money); Coppola’s preferred mode is more like experimental theatre, allowing for instinct and spontaneity. “That’s where the size of the film didn’t do him any favours,” says Figgis, “because the flexibility that he needs to go with that mindset isn’t supported by such a big production.” The net result was a lot of frustration and wasted time, all on Coppola’s dime. “Every day his regime was, he would get up early, make lots and lots of notes, and then he’d turn up and make everyone a bit crazy by going: ‘I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want to shoot that today actually. Can we get Adam Driver?’ ‘No, it’s his day off.’ ‘How long is it going to take to get him on the set?’ ‘Three hours.’ ‘OK. What should we do?’” Figgis recalls. “He’s in his 80s, so he’s basically just sitting there waiting, which for me was a joy, of course, because in those periods, he’s very happy to talk, have a moan or tell stories about Brando or whatever.” Meanwhile, throughout the shoot, Coppola was staying in an old Atlanta hotel that he had bought and decided to renovate – so he would go home every night to another, parallel project. “He invited me to live in the hotel,” says Figgis, “and someone said: ‘Mike, they start work at six in the morning. There’s dust everywhere. It’s so noisy, you won’t get any sleep.’ So I declined and got a hotel in Atlanta.” When Figgis suggests to Coppola that he seems to thrive on chaos, however, he immediately rebuts the notion. “He says: ‘I’m very good with chaos. I make order out of chaos.’ But he then dodges the question of: ‘Did you actually create the chaos in order to fix the chaos?’ But that’s not unusual for film-makers or artists in general, who kind of throw everything up in the air and see how it lands.” There was another troubled aspect of the shoot that Figgis’s film doesn’t address. When I spoke to former crew members who had worked on Megalopolis before its premiere at Cannes last year, several reported concerns about Coppola’s behaviour on set, not least a bacchanalian party scene during which witnesses say the director tried to kiss some of the topless and scantily clad female extras. The film’s executive producer Darren Demetre told the Guardian at the time that Coppola “walked around the set to establish the spirit of the scene by giving kind hugs and kisses on the cheek to the cast and background players. It was his way to help inspire and establish the club atmosphere.” Some extras recalled their experience of working on the film differently; one cast member described it to Variety as “super weird and uncomfortable”. Figgis did not witness any inappropriate behaviour, he says. “My obsession was film-making and the process. There are hundreds of people [on set], and there’s adoring fans everywhere who want to take a selfie with Francis and all the rest of it. And he likes that. Outside the film-making thing, he’s a very warm and affectionate person. So I had no sense of what emerged later. And, you know, I was a little bit puzzled by it, I have to say.” Some critics praised Megalopolis, others were less enamoured (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw found it “bloated, boring and bafflingly shallow”). Even Figgis admits he never fully understood the script: “It was like reading a Russian novel.” The movie has not been a commercial success: to date it has made $14m. But then Apocalypse Now was not hailed as a classic until long after its initial release. Perhaps Megalopolis will undergo a similar process of rehabilitation, with its themes of authoritarian control, political scheming and utopian idealism. If it does, Figgis’s film will doubtless be a part of that. Whatever his views on the script, Figgis is full of admiration for Coppola as a film-maker. “The process for him has always been one of experimentation and actually, putting that into perspective, who else is doing that? Nobody. Whether you like the film or you don’t like the film, no one of that stature is doing it.” Others agree. In the documentary, George Lucas tells Figgis: “My whole career is based on watching Francis.” But he says they are complete opposites: “I’m a plodding along, careful what I’m doing, plan it out … and he’s a jump-off-the-cliff guy.” Watching Coppola contend with all the challenges and setbacks on set, making his way through a stressful four-month shoot, contending with the illness of his wife of 60 years, Eleanor (who died in April 2024), all while maintaining superhuman energy levels for an man in his 80s, it feels as if simply getting Megalopolis made, and walking the Cannes red carpet one last time, was success enough for Coppola. Perhaps it will come to be seen as the last, defiant moonshot from a larger-than-life film-maker who always cared more about art than money. Does Figgis think Coppola had fun? “Well, he didn’t look very happy a lot of the time,” he says. “But there were times I saw him chuckling and I thought: ‘Oh, he is sort of having fun now.’ Because he’s got a bunch of actors around him, they’re all kind of vibing with each other, it’s raining, and there’s, like, this chaos to be dealt with. He would have had more fun had everybody been more prepared for what he actually wanted, except he didn’t quite know what he wanted at the outset. But ultimately, I think he’s glad he made the film, because it was something that was sitting there on his back burner, and he wanted to get through it and articulate those ideas.” He laughs. “But I think we all have a different idea of fun.” • Megadoc screened at the Venice film festival.", "section": "Film", "query": "Ford", "companies": ["Ford"]}

The conservative politician who oversees Canada’s most populous province – and its largest economy – made the admission to caucus and supporters, in off-the-cuff remarks accidentally caught by a nearby microphone. But, Ford said, after Trump announced tariffs on Canada, he was devastated. “The guy pulled out the knife and fucking yanked it into us,” Ford said. “We’re supposed to be his closest allies, his closest friend. It’s terrible.” Ford, a blunt-spoken, burly populist with a “limestone head” and a knack for politics, sensed opportunity in the devastation. He called a snap election, telling voters he needed the “largest mandate in Ontario history” to combat an existential threat to the province’s economy. The move was derided as opportunism by other party leaders who accused Ford of “answering chaos by creating more chaos”. Despised among progressives for the province’s crumbling healthcare system, underfunded schools and a scandal that could have put billions in the pocket of land developers, Ford has now fashioned himself as “Captain Canada” – even leaving the campaign trail twice to lobby leaders in Washington. Now, as millions of Ontarians prepare to cast their ballot on Thursday for the province’s next leader, the stunning rise of Ford as a dominant political force – not just in Ontario but across the country – has put the 60-year-old populist in uncharted territory. No Ontario leader has ever won three successive majorities, with each one larger than the last. If Ford accomplishes this, it will reflect a unique political acumen which includes empathy and ruthlessness. For years Doug toiled in the shadow of his late brother Rob, whose scandal-ridden tenure as mayor of Toronto was notorious for his use of crack cocaine. When Rob contracted cancer and was unable to continue his mayoral campaign in 2014 it was Doug who ran in his place. He lost, but the bid positioned Doug as the heir to a brash, populist movement that appealed to disaffected suburban voters and affluent, pro-business supporters. After Rob died in 2016, Doug set his sights higher, and in 2018, after a hard-fought race, he was elected to become Ontario’s premier with a commanding legislative majority. Ford has cultivated a reputation as a leader preoccupied by the daily frustrations of residents. Like Rob, he is famous for handing his phone number out to anyone who asks. During snowstorms, he shovels driveways and helps stranded motorists. “The thing about Doug Ford is that he really cares about people. And I know every politician supposedly says that, right? That’s cliche, but with him, I truly believe it’s sincere – and he wants to do good things and do right by people,” said Fred DeLorey, a senior adviser for the premier’s 2025 election campaign. “I’ve known him as a political opponent and someone I’ve worked with for years and I can honestly say I’ve never seen anyone like him.” Ford’s father, Doug Sr, won a seat in the Ontario legislative assembly in the early 1990s, and the family – who run a lucrative label-making business – became a mainstay of conservative politics. Dave Bidini, the publisher of Toronto’s West End Phoenix newspaper, grew up in Etobicoke, the same Toronto suburb as the Ford family, and says the brothers’ reputation cast a long shadow. “There was a notoriety to a lot of the families in that neighbourhood: a lot of bad behaviour, a lot of wealth, a lot of privilege, lot of early fast cars,” he said. And, according to reporting from the Globe and Mail in 2013, Doug dealt hashish in the 1980s. “Most people didn’t approach Doug looking for product. You went to the guys that he supplied,” one former dealer told the Globe. “Because if Doug didn’t know you and trust you, he wouldn’t even roll down his window.” Ford has repeatedly denied the allegations and his lawyer says the Globe’s reporting is the “height of irresponsible and unprofessional journalism given the gravely serious and specious allegations of substantial criminal conduct”. Early in his tenure as premier, Ford won praise for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, following public health messaging – and at times breaking with other conservative leaders. When a report revealed the “horrific” state of the province’s long-term care homes during the crisis, Ford broke down at a press conference as he demanded accountability. To his critics, however, he governs like a vengeful leader bearing a grudge against Toronto, the city that has never supported him. “People call him a populist but when you look at it, his politics are just so petty and vindictive,” says Bidini. Ford has repeatedly clashed with residents and activists over plans to remove bike lanes from downtown Toronto, plans for a controversial private spa on public lands, a decision to shutter the city’s beloved science centre, and teacher strikes over class sizes. “When he was a councillor at city hall, he just caused chaos,” Bidini said. “And I don’t necessarily think that was a strategic move. I just think that that’s just kind of who he is. And you can see that now – a lot of his politics are just trying to see what he can get away with.” In 2022, Ford found his government embroiled in a deepening scandal over a controversial multibillion-dollar land swap deal. The plan, which opened 7,400 acres of protected land, dubbed the Greenbelt, for development, would have given windfall profits to developers. The premier eventually reversed course, but the scandal cost him a pair of cabinet ministers, two damning reports from government watchdogs and public outrage. At a somber press conference, Ford said it was “mistake” to allow development in the green belt around Toronto. “I made a promise to you that I wouldn’t touch the green belt. I broke that promise. And for that, I am very, very sorry,” he told reporters. Canada’s federal police are currently investigating the issue, but Ontario’s ethics commissioner cleared Ford of any wrongdoing. Still, Ford has largely resisted the partisan nature of modern politics, breaking with other Conservative premiers and cultivating close friendships with key figures in opposing parties like Chrystia Freeland, then federal finance minister. “Above all, Ford is a pragmatist. He’s clearly intent on achieving and maintaining office. But I do think he has a core commitment to the ‘little guy’ and that really seems to drive a lot of his decisions,” said Andrea Lawlor, an associate professor of political science at McMaster University. The result is a conservative leader able to pull support away from progressive parties and successfully court some union endorsements. “And in an era of deep political polarization, especially from party leaders, Ford has largely defied that approach. He doesn’t dig in on ideology or wear the partisan stripes. He appears to have sidestepped that.” With those skills, Ford emerged as one of the strongest pro-Canada voices against the backdrop of a looming trade war, at times drawing praise across the political aisle. He is a fixture of American television news, where he makes the case against possible tariffs. Ford’s rise fills a perceived vacuum of national leadership, following the resignation of the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, in early January. Before a high-stakes meeting with Canadian leaders in preparation for American tariffs, Ford, strode into the summit wearing a Maga-style hat with the message: “CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE”. “We will never be for sale,” Ford told the Guardian last month. “We don’t want to retaliate. We really don’t. But if it comes down to it, [the Americans] are going to feel pain.” DeLorey, a senior adviser on the campaign, says Ford’s “Captain Canada” branding reflects Ford’s instinct for leadership. “He’s genuinely very concerned about the province, and about where, what the impact tariffs will have on us.” Bidini, however, described Ford’s latest midwinter election gamble as a calculated move to hold on to power in the face of a wary, demoralized electorate. “He called this election in the dark depths of winter. People in my neighbourhood don’t even know who’s running because the ground is so frozen you can’t stake a sign in it. The sidewalks are slippery and covered in snow and there it’s bitterly cold out,” he said. “It’s hard to mount a campaign when you’re up against the elements. It’s the perfect conditions for a person like Ford to get the win that he wants and to perfect his narrative.”", "section": "World news", "query": "Ford", "companies": ["Ford"]}

More than a decade after the original “dieselgate” scandal broke, lawyers representing 1.6 million diesel car owners in the UK argue that manufacturers deliberately installed software to rig emissions tests. They allege the “prohibited defeat devices” could detect when the cars were under test conditions and ensure that harmful NOx emissions were kept within legal limits, duping regulators and drivers. Should the claim be upheld, estimated damages could exceed £6bn. The three-month hearing that opened at London’s high court on Monday will focus on vehicles sold by five manufacturers – Mercedes, Ford, Renault, Nissan and Peugeot/Citroën – from 2009. In “real world” conditions, when driven on the road, lawyers argue, the cars produced much higher levels of emissions. The judgment on the five lead defendants will also bind other manufacturers including Jaguar Land Rover, Vauxhall/Opel, Volkswagen/Porsche, BMW, FCA/Suzuki, Volvo, Hyundai-Kia, Toyota and Mazda, whose cases are not being heard to reduce the case time and costs. Opening the case for the claimants, Thomas de la Mare KC said: “Each player in the industry basically took a conscious decision that customer convenience, which helped the industry sell more cars, was more important than reducing pollutants causing death.” In written submissions, the claimants quoted a Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air report that found excess NOx emissions had caused 124,000 premature deaths in the UK and Europe between 2009 and 2024. De la Mare told the high court levels of emissions could have easily been reduced had vehicles had larger tanks for AdBlue – an additive that cuts NOx in diesel vehicles – and asked customers to refill them. Instead, he said: “They have basically said the concern about making these cars sellable by removing these inconveniences is so strong … that we would rather cheat than comply with the law.” The lead barrister also told the judge, Mrs Justice Cockerill, that manufacturers were trying to argue that numerous prior dieselgate rulings abroad, including in the US and European court of justice, did not apply to the UK. He said: “Our position is broadly that we will rely on foreign regulatory decisions as a matter of fact, rather than an opinion on law.” He said the defendants’ argument meant that “mainland GB becomes a sort of defeat device Brexit Island … But Northern Ireland is applying case law that you’re being asked to put in the bin.” Internal training and briefing documents from Ford in 2010 on defeat devices showed that “the manufacturers could and did understand the law exactly as we do now”, De la Mare said. Lawyers for the defendants will make opening statements later this week. The car manufacturers deny having used prohibited defeat devices. In written submissions, lawyers for Renault said the case was “riddled with errors and misunderstandings, especially about the design and operation of the vehicles’ emission control systems” while Ford’s said it was “scientifically illiterate”. Mercedes said the claimants case was “obsessively focused” on NOx pollution rather than other emissions, and did not “acknowledge the complexity” of diesel engineering. Lawyers for Nissan said the case’s central legal premise was “an untenably broad reading of defeat device”. The main trial, establishing the evidence, is expected to conclude before Christmas, with a break before legal arguments are heard in March 2026. A judgment is expected next summer, with a further trial for possible compensation following. Adam Kamenetzky, from south London, a lead claimant among the 1.6 million owners, told the Guardian outside court: “For the first time, certainly in the UK if not in any jurisdiction, the evidence is actually being made public. “If these allegations are borne out, consumers were deceived at the point of sale, and there needs to be action taken to prevent this kind of deception being built into cars.” Clean air campaigners including Mums for Lungs and Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose daughter Ella’s death was the first to be officially linked to air pollution, demonstrated outside court. Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said that “illegal pollution from diesel vehicles has caused thousands of premature deaths in the UK,” adding that she hoped for a “day of reckoning” over the use of the fuel. The landmark claims have been brought by more than 20 law firms, led by Leigh Day and Pogust Goodhead. Leigh Day’s senior partner Martyn Day said the claims, “if proven, would demonstrate one of the most egregious breaches of corporate trust in modern times”. Alicia Alinia, the chief executive of Pogust Goodhead, said the case would go “the heart of corporate accountability and environmental justice”.", "section": "Business", "query": "Ford", "companies": ["Ford"]}

The time has come to acknowledge Eleanor Coppola’s magnificent achievement here as first among equals of the credited directors in shooting the original location footage (later interspersed with interviews by Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper), getting the stunningly intimate audio tapes of her husband Francis’s meltdown moments and, of course, in unassumingly keeping the family together while it was all going on. With his personal and financial capital very high after The Conversation and the Godfather films, Coppola put up his own money and mortgaged property to make this stunningly audacious and toweringly mad version of Joseph Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness from a script by John Milius; it is transplanted from 19th-century Belgian Congo where a rogue ivory trader has gone native in the dark interior, to south-east Asia during the Vietnam war where a brilliant US army officer is now reportedly being worshipped as a god among the Indigenous peoples and must have his command terminated “with extreme prejudice”. Marlon Brando had a whispery voiced cameo as the reclusive demi-deity, Martin Sheen was the troubled Captain Willard tasked with taking Kurtz down and Robert Duvall is the psychotically gung-ho Lt Col Kilgore, who leads a helicopter assault. Haemorrhaging money and going insanely over-schedule, Coppola shot his film in the Philippines during burning heat, humidity and monsoons and borrowed army helicopters and pilots from President Ferdinand Marcos, only to find that on many occasions – especially during the legendary Ride of the Valkyries attack scene – filming had to halt as the Filipino military would ask for their helicopters back so they could suppress a communist insurgency. In fact, Coppola found himself reproducing reality on a 1:1 scale. As he said in his Cannes press conference, which opens the documentary: “The film is not about Vietnam; it is Vietnam, it’s what it was really like.” Well, bravura auteur rhetoric is an accepted Cannes press conference tradition. The film was arguably just what Vietnam was like for the Americans – though nobody actually died and perhaps it is time to re-state something about Vietnam that gets lost for later generations: a considerable proportion of US soldiers were drafted. The agony was there from the beginning. Coppola originally cast Harvey Keitel as Willard but didn’t like what he was doing and fired him on pretty much the first day – a traumatic and legally fraught event that can’t be talked about too clearly in the documentary. Sheen, the replacement, was a heavy drinker and smoker whose “breakdown” scene in his seedy Saigon hotel room was a dangerous, booze-fuelled improvisation. It was a personal primal scream, which contributed so much to his stress that he had a near-fatal heart attack, almost scuppering the entire production. The documentary’s most gripping moment is Coppola yelling at someone on the phone not to talk about Sheen’s heart attack in case the resulting gossip causes his financial backers to lose their nerve. Sam Bottoms, playing one of Willard’s crew, talks cheerfully about doing speed and LSD during filming; he can’t have been the only one. And all the time Coppola was suppressing intense anxiety that he was making a mediocre, pretentious movie. Like Conrad, he wanted to satirise the hubris and grotesque vanity of the west’s imperial ambitions – and there is something else as well. Willard comes to understand that in killing Kurtz, he is not interrupting or thwarting his occult ritual; he is in fact participating in it, and completing it. Perhaps Coppola came to believe something similar, that he was having his own epiphany-slash-nervous-breakdown in the jungle. It wasn’t quite an apocalypse for him, although he arguably never made anything as good again. As it is, it might have been good to have had Coppola and Milius discuss that title: it sounds like a demand, coming from someone who won’t wait for apocalypse a moment longer. It might be prescriptive and absurd, but as with the film itself, you wind up believing in it. • Hearts of Darkness: A Film-Maker’s Apocalypse is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 July, and on UHD and Blu-ray from 28 July.", "section": "Film", "query": "Ford", "companies": ["Ford"]}

But for all its big-hitting visual ambition, philosophical window dressing and pick-and-mix literary references, this is a work of screaming emptiness. A strident retro-futurist folly that blends Ken Russell-esque kitsch with swaggering self-importance, the film lays out its central conceit – that modern America follows the template of Old Rome – with a reverence that this idea doesn’t really warrant. Coppola carves his opening statement on a stone plaque in a classical font, and then for good measure has Laurence Fishburne narrate the words while sounding as much like God himself as is humanly possible. America, rumbles Laurence portentously, like the Roman empire, is destined to be brought down by the greed and hubris of a few power-crazed men. The setting for the story is recognisably Manhattan – the Chrysler Building gets more screen time than some of the supporting characters – but in Coppola’s version, the city is renamed New Rome and features a bunch of characters lumbered with vaguely imperial-sounding names and dressed as if they stumbled out of a fetish-wear toga party. The city’s mayor is Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito) – Francis to his close friends – but despite sharing a name with the character, it seems likely that Coppola identifies more closely with the film’s central figure, Cesar Catilina (Adam Driver). Cicero is a small-minded sceptic, more intent on bolstering his power and influence than he is on embracing the radical changes that might just improve the lives of city dwellers. Cesar, meanwhile, is a radical dreamer and a visionary, a troubled genius whose ambition to create “Megalopolis” is too wild and brilliant for mere mortals to understand. A futuristic, shape-shifting metropolis built from a newly synthesised sustainable material, Megalopolis promises to change the very fabric of society. Not least because it requires huge swathes of the existing city to be destroyed to make way for it. Oh, and – small detail – Cesar also has the ability to stop time at will. Cesar and Cicero are sworn enemies; a key point of contention between them is Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), the mayor’s daughter. When we first meet her, in a Studio 54-style nightclub, full of gyrating lovelies licking cocaine off each other’s tits, she’s a party girl who is permanently one nipple-tassel incident away from a public scandal. (If Coppola could stop time, you suspect he would have done it back when it was still acceptable for 70% of a film’s female cast to be gyrating uber-minxes wearing Bacofoil bras). Julia is pursued by Clodio (Shia LaBeouf, minus eyebrows and self-respect), the obscenely wealthy scion of the Crassus banking empire. But she is fascinated by Cesar, who happens to be Clodio’s cousin. Meanwhile, Cesar is in an on-off relationship with an ambitious Wall Street reporter called Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza, whose vampy cartoon femme fatale is one of the film’s more enjoyable elements). One of the toughest challenges for a film-maker is conveying genius in a cinematic manner. Megalopolis avoids the hoariest of cliches (a frenzy of scrawled equations and diagrams on walls, windows and any other flat surface) but Coppola’s approach is little better: Cesar’s free-form jazz brainstorming session, with wacky human pyramid antics, is so mortifying that you risk chewing your fingers off in secondhand embarrassment. The film is not without redeeming features. The design departments – production and, particularly, costume – have gone all out, revelling in an opulently lush colour palette of regal dark reds and forest greens. And there’s the sheer scope of the ambition on show: I would rather watch a picture that shoots for the sky and misses rather than one that plods cautiously along in the safe zone. Still, this does fail on many and varied levels. The performances are wildly uneven, with Driver and Plaza gamely giving it their all, while Jon Voight, as bank owner Hamilton Crassus III, mugs like a panto villain and Dustin Hoffman barely registers as a presence in the film. But the main issue is an incoherent screenplay that seems in thrall to the very monstrous elite that the film attempts to skewer. A case in point: at one moment in the picture a satellite plunges from the heavens, scoring a direct hit on the city and causing, we imagine, untold devastation and misery. Kind of a big deal, you would think. But the event is dismissed in a couple of scenes as a casual aside, viewed, like everything in the story, from a rarefied position in the corridors of power. For a film that continually bangs on about the greater good and a new utopian future, this is possibly the least egalitarian piece of storytelling I’ve ever seen. The film stops short of describing them as proles, but the only time we get to see the ordinary folk of the city is when they are either gazing in mute, uncomprehending awe through a fence or when they are rioting.

Ford issued an urgent recall of its Kuga plug-in hybrid car in early March, warning drivers not to charge the battery because of a risk it might short-circuit while on the road. The problem could cause a loss of power or a fire, according to the recall notice. Four weeks later, the manufacturer has yet to announce a timescale for repairs and owners report that it is failing to respond to their requests for an update. David Ellis is one of an estimated 26,000 owners to have received the red-hatched letter from Ford warning of potential injury if the battery is plugged in. It instructs occupants to exit their vehicle immediately if the “stop safely now” warning is triggered while on the road and advises that it will be in touch when engineers have developed a software fix. However, it says that affected vehicles are still safe to drive. “The advice to exit the car quickly is alarming,” Ellis said. “My husband uses a hoist and a wheelchair so we can’t exit anywhere quickly. I therefore can’t drive him in the car until it is made safe.” Ellis bought his car eight months ago in order to reduce fuel costs and emissions. He says the monthly running costs have nearly doubled since he stopped charging the battery. “Aside from the safety issue, it calls into question Ford’s green credentials and customer service,” he said. “They have advised they are not proactively offering customers any form of recompense for increased fuel use or damage to the battery from lack of charging for up to four months.” Ford did not respond to requests for a comment. The recall affects the current-generation Kuga which has been on sale since 2019. There are more than 26,000 on the road across Europe. The manufacturer has suspended deliveries of new models until the software glitch has been addressed. It estimates that a remedy will be available to dealers by July, but given the number of affected vehicles, drivers face a wait of many more weeks for a repair slot. This is the second time the Ford Kuga has been recalled because of a potential fire hazard. In 2020 the manufacturer had to replace the battery units of more than 27,000 cars after seven caught fire while charging. Drivers could be held liable if an unresolved recall issue causes a crash. According to the Association of British Insurers, failure to inform a car insurance provider of a recall notice could invalidate their cover if they need to make a claim. Owners unwilling to wait indefinitely for a repair could demand a courtesy car or a refund, according to the consumer rights expert Martyn James. The Consumer Rights Act entitles consumers to a repair, replacement or refund if a purchase is not as described, fit for purpose or of satisfactory quality. “I would demand a timescale for a repair and if that turns out to be longer than is reasonable I’d ask to return the car,” James said. “If Ford refuses, that’s when you can start a small claims case.” Owners can also complain to The Motor Ombudsman which said that Ford had only just informed it of the recall. A spokesperson said: “We are in discussion with Ford as to their response to consumers who are affected by this issue, and clarification regarding when the work is to be undertaken on customer vehicles.”", "section": "Business", "query": "Ford", "companies": ["Ford"]}

Formerly the site of Barking Reach power station, these 17 hectares (42 acres) of industrial land at Dagenham Dock in east London were due to be redeveloped into a new, purpose-built wholesale food market for the capital. However, that changed late last year when the site’s owners, the City of London Corporation, announced it had cancelled the development, which would have relocated Smithfield meat market and Billingsgate fish market. The corporation, which is exceptionally wealthy compared with typical UK local authorities, blamed inflation and rising construction costs, despite having already spent just under £230m of the project’s £741m cost on buying and clearing the land. It has since faced a backlash over its plans to permanently close London’s ancient food markets in 2028. “The City of London ploughed a lot into clearing the site up,” says the local Labour MP, Margaret Mullane, looking through the gates at the vacant lot. The decision was a big blow for Dagenham, located north of the Thames on London’s eastern fringe, with a proud industrial heritage once synonymous with its Ford factory, where some of the carmaker’s best known vehicles – including the Model Y and Fiesta – rolled off the production line. The days of Ford’s dominance in the area are long gone since its 1950s heyday, when it employed about 40,000 people, compared with just under 2,000 now. Barking and Dagenham council expected the markets would bring 2,700 new jobs to the area, boosting the local economy in the London borough which is home to 220,000 people, and also has the unhappy status of recording some of the highest levels of deprivation in the capital. The area was also ranked fifth-worst in England in the most recent index of deprivation. A “food school” was also planned, which the corporation previously said would help create a new generation of market traders and “play a pivotal role in training future butchers, fishmongers and fruiterers, ensuring they acquire the essential skills to thrive in the industry”. The market development, which also envisaged the relocation of the fruit and vegetable market at nearby Leyton, formed a key part of the local plan for the borough published by Barking and Dagenham council just weeks before the corporation pulled the plug. “With the three markets not coming, and Ford, the public are quite rightly worried about unaffordable housing. What they tell politicians is it’s all about bringing good, well-paid jobs here, jobs you can raise a family on,” says Mullane, adding that many of the blocks of flats being built nearby are considered out of reach for local salary levels. “Our child poverty level is the same as Blackpool, and we have some of the lowest wages in London.” About nine months on from the decision, it is not clear what the future holds for the Dagenham site, which is still owned by the corporation, which manages assets worth billions of pounds, and collects £1.3bn in business rates annually, most of which it passes to central government. Dominic Twomey had not long been the Labour leader of Barking and Dagenham council when the cancellation of the markets development was announced. While he will not criticise the financial reasoning for the decision, he concedes the planned regeneration of the site is out of his control. “We’re in the hands of the corporation,” says Twomey. “We don’t even know whether they are planning to sell the site, or are waiting until the economy improves and are looking for other alternatives.” Twomey and other locals also regret the lost prospects for young people in the borough. “It’s more a regeneration loss in terms of potential opportunities, as opposed to a financial loss,” he says. “It is the opportunities it would have brought to the area both in terms of jobs and stimulating the economy there with all of the spin-offs that we might have hoped to get such as retail shops and restaurants.” In June, the corporation announced the creation of a regeneration team tasked with overseeing the redevelopment of the current Smithfield and Billingsgate sites – due to become a cultural destination and housing – as well as finding a new location for the markets, and working with local representatives on redeveloping the Dagenham site. The City of London Corporation says the plot is now open for other uses, adding that it is “perfectly placed to receive goods from around the world, via the Thames Estuary Gateway”. The corporation added it would be “more specific” about the future of the site once it has engaged with property developers. Chris Hayward, the corporation’s policy and resources chair, said: “The Barking Reach site in Dagenham Dock has the potential to be a real powerhouse for economic activity in the area, with uses that work hard for local people whilst also supporting the UK economy.” Lack of clarity about the future of the site is just one way in which Dagenham could be now said to be treading water. The nearby Thames freeport – which stretches eastward along the river past the Ford site to the London Gateway port in Thurrock, Essex – has recently hired consultants to draw up a master plan to “regenerate the region into a national centre for low-carbon industry, advanced logistics, and digital innovation”. Meanwhile, Ford still owns the sprawling 450-acre plant alongside the river, where it now builds just shy of 1m diesel engines a year for vehicles such as the Transit and converts vans into specialist vehicles such as ambulances. Two ships filled with cars dock daily at its jetty on the Thames, to be transported onwards to dealerships. However, the end of the road for diesel engines is in sight, before a planned phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars, and large parts of the plot are underused. A company spokesperson said an assessment was being carried out into the best future use of the site. In 2016, the carmaker sold off its stamping plant – where the strikes by sewing machinists, depicted in the film Made in Dagenham, resulted in the 1970 Equal Pay Act – that has since become a large new housing development, with 4,000 homes under construction. Despite such redevelopment of former industrial land, many residents feel let down that a long-promised railway station at Beam Park, designed to connect an area with poor transport links directly to the City of London, still has not been built, after the previous government withdrew its support. “It’s the whole reason we moved in,” says Lewis Richardson, a resident who moved to Beam Park in late 2022. “It was supposed to be built in a year or two, and my partner was going to jump on the train to work. Now we have to rent a parking spot.” One highlight of the council’s local plan has, however, come to fruition. A brand new film and television studio has recently opened in a somewhat unexpected location on a main road, opposite a Toby Carvery restaurant. Reality shows, drama and commercials are now being filmed on some of the 12 sound stages at Eastbrook Studios, the largest measuring almost a third of a hectare, while the complex also offers office and workshop space. Funded by the US investment firm Hackman Capital Partners and operated by its subsidiary MBS Group, the nine-hectare site was previously a Sanofi pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. The council acquired land with the goal of creating a “digital, science and tech cluster”, preventing it ending up as a supermarket distribution centre, says Stephen Hursthouse, MBS Group’s vice-president for studio real estate in UK and Ireland. “Part of the site’s appeal is its size,” says Hursthouse, driving around the huge complex in a golf buggy. “From our perspective, there’s a Travelodge over the road for crew, tick; a coffee shop, tick; the tube station is right there and it’s the closest studio of its size to central London.” While many film and TV productions tend to bring their own crews with them, Hurthouse believes there could in time be 5,000 people working at Eastbrook on multiple productions, and hopes this will inspire local young people. “Lots of people said it wouldn’t happen, but it was bold and it has been delivered,” he says. • This article was amended on 22 September 2025 to correct two picture captions that referred to the proposed Beam Park station as being a tube station.

Robert Ford and Bill Barrett were removed from the party via an email from Reform HQ on Monday, which said they had “undermined” the interests of the party and brought it into “disrepute”. Ford and Barrett sat on Kent county council alongside Oliver Bradshaw, Paul Thomas and Maxine Fothergill, who were also suspended last week. The Guardian understands Thomas, Bradshaw and Fothergill remain suspended pending investigation. Ford, a councillor for Maidstone Rural West, was suspended after allegations of misconduct in an “unofficial complaint” from several female members of Kent county council staff. Barrett, representing Ashford, had been critical of the council hierarchy, and was suspended alongside Thomas, Bradshaw and Fothergill. Ford has claimed no details were put to him about where, when and how he acted, according to the BBC. “There is not one shred of evidence against me,” he said. The suspensions and expulsions mean that 48 Reform councillors remain on the Kent council, after the party’s May election win of 57 seats. Two other councillors had been suspended, while a third has joined Ukip. A Reform spokesperson said: “Councillors Barrett and Ford have been expelled as their conduct undermined the interests of the party and brought Reform UK into disrepute.” The footage of the meeting in August, which was first published by the Guardian, revealed councillors complaining about “backbiting” and being ignored by their leader, Linden Kemkaran, who told them to “fucking suck it up” if they did not agree with her decisions. Kemkaran also called the council, which has a budget of more than £2.5bn, a “shop window” for what Reform could do if it ran the country. She is understood to have told her fellow councillors in an email the previous weekend that she had launched a hunt for the “cowards” who had leaked the recorded meeting. Antony Hook, the leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Kent county council, told the Guardian the “chaos” in the Reform group was having a direct impact on their constituents in need.

It’s perhaps notable for Harrison Ford playing a US president for the first time since Air Force One in 1997, but now with secret health worries and liable to succumb to a terrifying rage which turns him into Red Hulk (Red State Hulk?) who is the ultimate disruptor, putting his great big red fist through the West Wing. A novelty there, maybe, though he conforms to the time-honoured Hulk tradition of somehow having miraculously stretchy trousers so that the Red Hulk genitals are not exposed. As for the apparent Maga implications, Mr Ford has himself denied them, and the MCU is as cautiously apolitical as ever, though Ford’s character is certainly keener on international cooperation than the current real-life incumbent. Supersoldier Captain America is the title now conferred on Sam Wilson, played by the personable Anthony Mackie; the previous holder Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) having stepped down and gone back in time to his 1940s heyday. Wilson is astonished to receive an invitation to a reception at the White House, now presided over by the ex-general turned commander-in-chief Thaddeus Ross (Ford) – an enemy of the Avengers who is regretfully tormented by the thought that he has alienated his daughter Betty (Liv Tyler) on account of her relationship with Bruce Banner. Captain America shows up to the shindig with his buddy and protege Joaquin Torres, or Falcon (Danny Ramirez) and Korean war veteran Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly), who is bitter at his former imprisonment as a mistrusted supersoldier. The reception ends in violent chaos, connected with a sinister plan to exploit the powerful new element Adamantium recently discovered in Japanese waters, and to create warlike division between Japan and the US who might otherwise sign a treaty guaranteeing international ownership. Captain America and President Ross are going to have to put aside their differences to battle this new threat to the Pax Americana, which might have something to with the awful scientist Dr Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) whose shocking appearance perhaps indicates that no one on this production got the memo about stigmatising facial deformation. And so this convoluted green screen digital contrivance finally snakes its way to a suspended episode-conclusion; the action is moderate and it’s lacking in the steam-heat, humour and the surreal energy of superhero movies past.

But opposition parties criticized the move, calling it a “distraction” from an ongoing criminal investigation into the government’s handling of a controversial multibillion-dollar land swap. Ford, 60, ended months of speculation on Friday, telling reporters that he planned to meet province’s lieutenant governor early next week to dissolve his government and call an election which will take place on 27 February. He is seeking a third consecutive majority government for his right-of-center Progressive Conservatives. Ford previously won substantial electoral victories in 2022 and 2018 and said he wants to win “the largest mandate in Ontario’s history” in the February vote. Ontario, the country’s most populous province and its C$1.1tn economy is home to the manufacturing heartland. Experts believe Ontario would be badly hit if the new US president goes ahead with a threat to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports on 1 February. “The attack is coming against our families, our businesses, our communities, and with a strong mandate, we will be able to fight with Donald Trump,” Ford told reporters on Friday. He also decried a “lack of leadership at the federal level”, adding: “we don’t know who is going to be the next prime minister” following Justin Trudeau’s resignation earlier this month. Ford has emerged as one of the strongest voices against the expected tariffs and in recent weeks has been a frequent guest on US television shows. He has also floated the prospect of cutting off power supplies to the US and banning US alcohol products if necessary, staking out a position starkly different from other conservative premiers in the country. “The premier is likely thinking that if the tariffs come to pass, they’re going to have a real serious economic impact. Any retaliation by Canada is going to be very controversial and will have economic pains of its own,” said Randy Besco, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “And voters usually punish governments when the economy is bad, even if the government isn’t responsible. So they might suspect things could be bad a year from now. Right now, they feel they’re doing pretty well and can run on that.” But the premier’s political rivals have been critical of the decision, saying there is unified support in the province for a strong response to the tariffs. While Ford has indicated he will make the election about tariffs, opposition parties will probably shift the conversation towards what they say is a government embroiled in “corrupt” dealings and overreaching with controversial policies. Ontario’s Liberal leader, Bonnie Crombie, accused the premier of choosing “recklessness over responsibility” in a video message posted to social media. “[Ford is] answering chaos by creating more chaos at a time where we need stability and certainty,” she said. “This election shows us that the only job he’s interested in protecting is his own.” The New Democratic party leader said Ford had called the election as a way for Ford to “distract from the RCMP’s criminal investigation into his government”. In October 2023, federal police said they had opened a criminal investigation into a controversial plan to allow construction on greenbelt lands in Ontario, escalating a political scandal that has gripped the province and forced a number of high-profile government resignations. But both parties are polling far behind Ford’s Progressive Conservatives. “All the reasons that Ford wants an election is exactly the reasons opposition parties don’t want to have one,” said Besco.", "section": "World news", "query": "Ford", "companies": ["Ford"]}

England’s frustrated captain and head coach Steve Borthwick also backed a downcast George Ford to recover from his painful kicking misses and believe England will bounce back stronger against Australia next week. “We were in a position to win the game, and whenever you put yourselves in position to win and don’t come away with it you are disappointed,” said George, suggesting Ford should not be blamed for the outcome after failing to land a late penalty and an even later drop goal. “He hasn’t missed many in his career, so we certainly can’t blame him for that. “We actually did what we had spoken about. We had spoken about being in that exact position, we walked through being in that exact position and we felt like we were in control of it. We kept attacking them and unfortunately George missed the kick. If it goes slightly more left, we are talking about a very different result.” Borthwick also stressed the thin margins between success and failure after England’s third successive narrow late loss to the same opponents. “When you are in a position when you are winning by the margin we were at that time, there is clearly an opportunity to win the game. We gave them a window to get back and they did it. “They had 10 players from the World Cup final and had more caps in their 15 than we had in our 23. We didn’t get the win we wanted but everyone can see this team is developing into a very strong team. New Zealand are a quality side and since we last played together they have had seven Test matches and been together three months. “There are a lot of experienced players on the pitch and they knew what we were trying to do. The team in those drop goal situations has been pretty successful. We weren’t today but depending on the width of a post, the result goes one way or the other. That is the nature of Test rugby.” New Zealand were suitably relieved by the outcome with their head coach, Scott Robertson, quipping: “I don’t think George Ford has ever missed a drop kick in his life.” His captain Scott Barrett, however, suggested the All Blacks deserved to sneak home because they had sought to attack more often than their opponents. “They are a dangerous team but we potentially played a bit more rugby than them. I was pleased with our endeavour. They had every opportunity to win it. Going back to the last series, there have been three tight encounters and they had the opportunities to get their nose in front.” The All Black No 8 Ardie Savea also said he had expected Ford to slot the penalty.“I didn’t think we had that in the end. We got lucky with the penalty kick, but rugby is a game of fine margins and we will take it.

The announcement comes amid increasing public concern about the plastic sector’s environmental and climate impact. Two years ago, Bonta launched an investigation into fossil fuel and petrochemical producers “for their role in causing and exacerbating the global plastics pollution crisis”. As part of the investigation, he issued a subpoena to the oil giant ExxonMobil and plastic trade groups, seeking related documents. In May 2024, industry groups asked a US district court to block the subpoena, but a federal district judge this month preliminarily rejected their argument that the investigation violated the first amendment. A February report from the advocacy group Center for Climate Integrity (CCI) found that plastic producers have known for decades that plastic recycling is too cumbersome and pricey to become a feasible waste management solution, yet promoted it anyway. In a statement, the CCI president, Richard Wiles, called the legal challenge “the most important legal action to date in the global fight against plastic pollution”. Last year, California sued Exxon and four other big oil companies, accusing them of sowing climate doubt despite longstanding knowledge of their products’ contributions to global heating. Two dozen other US states and municipalities have filed similar legal challenges. “Just as Exxon knew and lied about how its fossil fuel products cause climate change, the polluter has also known and lied for decades about the reality that its plastic products could never be recycled at scale,” Wiles said. “From climate to plastics, Exxon’s entire business model is based on lying to the public about the harms its products cause.” In a statement, an ExxonMobil spokesperson said the company is “bringing real solutions, recycling plastic waste that couldn’t be recycled by traditional methods”. She blamed California officials – not the oil industry – for the plastic waste crisis. “For decades, California officials have known their recycling system isn’t effective,” she said. “They failed to act, and now they seek to blame others. Instead of suing us, they could have worked with us to fix the problem and keep plastic out of landfills.” Advocates hope the California suit, which was filed in San Francisco county superior court, will spur a wave of similar litigation. “Attorney General Bonta is leading the way to corporate accountability and a cleaner and healthier world,” Judith Enck, the head of anti-plastic advocacy group Beyond Plastics and a former senior Environmental Protection Agency official, said in a statement. “This lawsuit will set an invaluable precedent for others to follow.” Polling conducted by CCI and the progressive polling firm Data for Progress this month found a majority of American voters, including 54% of Republicans, would support legal efforts to hold oil and petrochemicals responsible for the plastic crisis. On Sunday, Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, also signed a law banning the distribution of plastic shopping bags.", "section": "US news", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

But the iron ore billionaire, who is not himself a defendant in the case, said he is “personally delighted” at the court action and that “Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-examination”. ExxonMobil’s suit accuses the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, and several environmental groups of conspiring to defame it by making statements criticising its plastics recycling technology. Bonta sued ExxonMobil last year, saying the company had engaged in decades-long deception about the limitations of its plastics recycling regime. A Forrest-linked charity, the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund (IEJF), is a named defendant in the suit, alongside US environmental groups the Sierra Club, San Francisco Baykeeper, Heal the Bay, and the Surfrider Foundation. The California-based groups have filed a countersuit against ExxonMobil. The lawsuit, filed in Texas, claims that IEJF retained US lawyers Cotchett to engage in “political activities”, including filing a lawsuit against ExxonMobil. It seeks damages and retractions of “defamatory statements” from Bonta and the groups. “Together, Bonta and the US Proxies – the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the Foreign Interests – have engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil’s effective and innovative advanced recycling technology is a ‘false promise’ and ‘not based on truth,’” the company said in its lawsuit. Forrest is not a defendant in the case, but is mentioned by name more than 20 times in the claim filed before the court, including allegations he harboured a “dream of upending the American oil-and-gas industry”. Forrest issued a statement saying he welcomed the lawsuit, which he described as “right out of the oil and gas industry playbook”. “I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-examination,” Forrest said. He said the fossil industry was living on “borrowed time”. “The fossil fuel industry is getting increasingly desperate at maintaining its toxic grip on society. Their only priority is to maximise their profits and produce as much oil and gas as possible.” ExxonMobil claims its case has been brought in response to “the corrupting influence of foreign money in the American legal system and … the sordid for-profit incentives and outright greed that tries to hide behind so-called public impact litigation”. The suit alleges the Forrest-linked charity IEFJ has directed thousands of dollars to US law firm Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy to fund “smear campaigns” run by Bonta and US environmental groups condemning Exxon and ridiculing its plastics recycling program as a “myth” and a “sham”. “Why would Mr Bonta or anyone who claims to be serious about cleaning up the environment and helping solve the plastic-waste issue take such extreme measures to shut down the emerging and developing advanced recycling industry?” the ExxonMobil complaint asks. “The answer is foreign influence, personal ambition, and a murky source of financing rife with conflicting business interests.” ExxonMobil alleges a chain of conspiracy against it. Its claim, filed in Texas’s eastern district, states that Forrest’s Fortescue competes directly with ExxonMobil in the low-carbon-energy sectors. “Having failed to successfully compete against ExxonMobil in the marketplace, Fortescue has, on information and belief, orchestrated a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company’s self-interested purposes,” the Exxon complaint said. “More specifically, Fortescue funds Minderoo, which owns and controls the IEJF, which hired an American law firm to bring claims against ExxonMobil on behalf of the US Proxies. “The majority of the wealth used by Minderoo comes directly from its holdings in Fortescue. The IEJF and Minderoo share executives with Fortescue. All of which leads to the conclusion that the IEJF’s interests are directly tied to those of Fortescue.” Minderoo, in a statement, rejected Exxon’s characterisation of its relationship with IEFJ: “Minderoo is a philanthropy which is independent of the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund.” A spokesperson for Minderoo said it was committed to reducing the production of plastics which have a devastating impact on human health. “In 2021, Minderoo published the Plastic Waste Makers index, which revealed the largest contributors to the global plastics crisis, finding that just 20 companies … were responsible for producing more than 50% of single use plastic worldwide. ExxonMobil topped the list of polymer producers,” the spokesperson said. Fortescue said in a statement while it was not a named defendant in the proceedings, it is mentioned repeatedly in the claim. “Fortescue rejects the assertions that Exxon Mobil has made against Fortescue in the complaint, including the assertions that the Company has orchestrated litigation against Exxon to gain a competitive advantage.” Responding on behalf of Bonta, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice said the Texas lawsuit was “another attempt from ExxonMobil to deflect attention from its own unlawful deception”. “The attorney general is proud to advance his lawsuit against ExxonMobil and looks forward to vigorously litigating this case in court.” In a statement, the IEFJ said it was a non-profit “registered with and regulated by the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission”. “Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund is not a subsidiary of, owned, or controlled by Minderoo Foundation or Fortescue Metals Group.”", "section": "Australia news", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Hours before they convened, another US energy conglomerate, ConocoPhillips, announced plans to buy Marathon Oil in an all-stock deal worth about $17.1bn – rendering it the latest firm to place a vast bet on the future of fossil fuel production. The meetings come as both Exxon and Chevron are under investigation by Democrats for a recent dinner with Donald Trump, where he reportedly made a quid-pro-quo offer to oil bosses. Both Chevron and Exxon have also come under fire for promoting doubt about global warming despite knowledge of its harms, and for reneging on previous climate pledges as gas prices have risen. In October, ExxonMobil agreed to buy the shale group Pioneer Natural Resources, while Chevron announced plans to acquire the Texas oil company Hess – two of the country’s largest oil and gas deals in decades. ExxonMobil completed its acquisition earlier this month, while Chevron is vying to get its deal across the line. Environmental campaigners have condemned these deals, warning that they risk exacerbating the climate crisis by enabling big oil operators to grow even larger despite scientific consensus that fossil fuel must be phased out to avert climate catastrophe. ConocoPhillips’s takeover of Marathon Oil – valued at $22.5bn, when including $5.4bn in debt – comes amid climbing oil prices. Crude prices have jumped more than 12% this year, and the cost of a barrel rose above $80 this week. “As oil and gas companies continue to merge and acquire one another, it raises serious questions about the industry’s commitment to reducing emissions and transitioning to cleaner forms of energy,” said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, which focuses on oil industry accountability. “These deals, worth tens of billions of dollars, suggest that major players are still betting heavily on a future dominated by fossil fuels.” While oil giants remain under pressure over their climate impact, Exxon shareholders voted to re-elect the firm’s chair Darren Woods, lead director Joseph Hooley, and all 12 directors to the company’s board. The firm had been grappling with a “vote no” campaign, launched in response to a lawsuit Exxon filed against investors pushing to curb the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. The largest public pension manager in the US, the California Public Employment Retirement System, voted against every board member’s re-election in response to the company’s lawsuit against Arjuna Capital and Follow This, activist investor groups that submitted a shareholder proposal earlier this year to commit Exxon to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon claims the shareholder proposal seeks to undermine the company’s business. Investors in Chevron also re-elected all 12 of the firm’s board directors, throwing their weight behind the oil major’s leadership. Chevron has faced criticism amid the war in Gaza for extracting gas claimed by Israel in the eastern Mediterranean. As its shareholders gathered in the Bay Area on Wednesday morning, dozens of protesters blockaded the entrance to the oil company’s headquarters to call for it to divest from operations in Israel and for consumers to boycott the company. “Chevron is literally fueling the genocide being waged against Palestinians,” said Matt Leonard of the Oil and Gas Action Network. Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips chair and CEO, declared that its deal for Marathon Oil would add “high-quality, low cost of supply inventory” to the firm’s operations. “Importantly”, he added, ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil “share similar values and cultures with a focus on operating safely and responsibly to create long-term value for our shareholders”. Lee Tillman, Marathon Oil chair, president and CEO, hailed a “proud moment” for his company, which he claimed had remained “true to our core values of safety and environmental excellence” while generating “compelling” returns for its shareholders. The deal, which requires approval from Marathon Oil stockholders and clearance by regulators, is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The recently approved Exxon-Pioneer merger has also faced FTC scrutiny after the regulatory body claimed that Pioneer’s former CEO Scott Sheffield had attempted to privately coordinate with Opec+ officials to keep fuel prices high.

The numbers are clear. The people have spoken in an overwhelming way. We have won these elections with a remarkable margin,” he told the Guardian on Wednesday. Tasked with turning the South American nation’s newfound oil riches into prosperity while navigating tensions with neighbouring Venezuela, Ali faces the uphill challenge of reconstructing a country with the highest proven crude oil reserves per capita but one of the highest poverty levels in Latin America. According to a 2024 report by the Inter-American Development Bank, 58% of Guyanese live in poverty despite an oil boom that has quadrupled the state budget since production began in 2019. Official final results of Monday’s vote have not yet been published and some parties have called for a recount in some electoral districts, but preliminary numbers show a shake-up for the South American country’s opposition. The upstart, We Invest in Nationhood (Win) party, which was founded just three months ago by business magnate Azruddin Mohamed, is currently second in terms of votes. With more than 109,000 votes, one district and the possibility of another, Win is set to dethrone the longstanding A Partnership for National Unity (APNU) as the country’s main opposition. At the latest tally, APNU, which was in power before Ali took office in 2020, had just under 78,000 votes. Amanzia Walton-Desir, who stood in the presidential race, lamented that Guyanese are still poor despite “wealth coming into this country like we’ve never had.” She argued that government spending on infrastructure and social subsidies were contributing to inflation. Ali’s party, the People’s Progressive Party/ Civic (PPP/C) will win the most votes in Region Four, the country’s largest electoral district and one that the party has never won since Guyana’s independence in 1966. However, it fell short of a complete majority and will need the backing of one of the smaller parties to govern the region. Voting to choose 65 members of parliament and a government followed months of campaigning focused on how riches from the country’s hydrocarbon boom should be spent. The country of about 800,000 people has earned $7.5bn in revenue from oil sales and royalties since ExxonMobil started pumping offshore oil in late 2019, making Guyana one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. “We have delivered everything we set out to do over the last five years and that is why they trust us with our vision and agenda for the next five years,” Ali told the Guardian. His government has channelled oil revenue into building roads, schools and hospitals, and made studying at state university free. The International Monetary Fund has listed the country’s GDP at almost US$26bn, nearly five times what it was five years ago. But opposition parties have decried what they say is unfair distribution of oil earnings to groups connected to the ruling PPP/C. The PPP/C denies these allegations. Win came into the race as a wildcard, but benefited from Mohamed’s strong social media following. Mohamed, a member of one of Guyana’s wealthiest families, was sanctioned alongside his father by the US over allegations they defrauded Guyana’s government of tax revenue and bribed public officials. The Mohameds have denied all wrongdoing. Election observers from the Caribbean Community (Caricom), a bloc of 15 countries, the Commonwealth, the European Union and the Carter Centre commended the peaceful environment before and during the polls. However, they raised concerns about the mistrust and lack of clarity over the official list of people who qualify to vote, with the Caricom statement referring to the “perceived ‘bloated’ nature of the voters list”. In a statement on behalf of the Commonwealth observer group, chairperson, Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, expressed concerns about the “very limited implementation of the recommendations of observer groups over the years”. Much of the crude reserves are in a region that makes up two-thirds of Guyana’s territory but is also claimed by once-rich petrostate Venezuela. A territorial dispute between the neighbours has intensified since ExxonMobil discovered the massive offshore oil deposits a decade ago. The region has been administered by Guyana for over 100 years.", "section": "World news", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The research has been hailed as a “leap forward” in the legal battle to hold big oil accountable for the damages being caused by the climate crisis. The research found that the emissions from any one of the 14 biggest companies were by themselves enough to cause more than 50 heatwaves that would otherwise have been virtually impossible. The study shows, in effect, that those emissions caused the heatwaves. The carbon pollution from ExxonMobil’s fossil fuels, for example, made 51 heatwaves at least 10,000 times more likely than in an unheated world, the researchers found, as did the emissions from Saudi Aramco. Global heating is making heatwaves more frequent and more intense across the globe, contributing to at least 500,000 heat-related deaths a year. The searing heatwave that struck the Pacific north-west of the US in 2021 was made almost 3C hotter, for example. The new research found that the total emissions from the 180 “carbon major” companies included in the analysis were responsible for about half the increase in intensity, with emissions due to forest destruction making up most of the rest. It also found that the 213 heatwaves studied became 200 times more likely on average from 2010 to 2019 owing to the climate crisis. “Being able to trace back the contribution of these single [carbon major] emitters and quantify their contribution could be very useful for establishing potential liability,” said Prof Sonia Seneviratne, at ETH Zurich university in Switzerland, a senior author of the report. Dr Davide Faranda, a research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and not part of the study team, said: “This study adds a crucial new step: it connects the dots between specific climate disasters and the companies whose emissions made them possible. This bridge could become a cornerstone for legal and policy action to hold polluters accountable.” Cassidy DiPaola, a spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, said: “We can now point to specific heatwaves and say, ‘Saudi Aramco did this. ExxonMobil did this.’ When their emissions alone are triggering heatwaves that wouldn’t have happened otherwise, we’re talking about real people who died, real crops that failed, and real communities that suffered, all because of decisions made in corporate boardrooms.” The world’s highest court, the international court of justice, ruled in July that failing to prevent climate harm could result in having to pay compensation, while a German high court set a legal precedent in May that fossil fuel companies could be held liable for their contribution. “Here’s the evidence the courts have been waiting for,” said DiPaola. “The bill is coming due, and it’s time these polluters pay for the damage they’ve done.” The research, published in the journal Nature, used a type of analysis called attribution. This compares the hotter world today with the world before mass burning of fossil fuels to assess how emissions have driven up temperatures, using weather data and computer models. The scientists first worked out how much each carbon major’s emissions had pushed up temperatures and then how much these higher temperatures increased the likelihood of heatwaves. Previous research has linked hundreds of individual events to global heating, but this study is the first to systematically analyse a series of events. “Climate change has made each of the 213 heatwaves more likely and more intense, and the situation has worsened over time,” said Dr Yann Quilcaille of ETH Zurich, the lead author of the study. The research found the increase in average intensity of the heatwaves rose from 1.4C in 2000-09 to 2.2C in 2020-23. The 213 major heatwaves assessed happened from 2000 to 2023 and spanned every continent. The data on them was taken from the biggest disaster database, EM-DAT, but Africa and South America were significantly underrepresented due to lack of reporting and suitable weather data. “The study’s findings likely underestimate the true scale of these events, and the real consequences are probably far greater,” said Dr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London. Even the emissions from the fossil fuel companies at the bottom of the list of carbon majors had a significant impact on heatwaves. The carbon pollution from each of these caused 16 heatwaves to become at least 10,000 times more likely than before the climate crisis. “This study is a leap forward that could be used to support future climate lawsuits,” said Dr Karsten Haustein, at the University of Leipzig in Germany, and not part of the study team. “It is also a reminder that denial and anti-science rhetoric will not make climate liability go away.” Carbon emissions are emitted when people use oil, gas or coal to heat their homes or power their transport, but Quilcaille said fossil fuel companies had a particular responsibility – they had pursued profit through disinformation and lobbying, despite having known since the 1980s that burning fossil fuels would lead to global heating. However, no polluter had yet been held accountable in court and challenges remained, said Prof Michael Gerrard and Dr Jessica Wentz, of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “The problem is the various legal issues that must be resolved before scientists can take the witness stand,” they said in a commentary in Nature. The issues included which courts should hear the cases, whether fossil-fuel producers should be liable for their customers’ emissions, and if long campaigns of deception by some fossil fuel companies were relevant, Gerrard and Wentz said. “The new study is one more building block, and a useful one, but the road to actual liability for the carbon majors is still littered with legal and evidentiary potholes,” they said.

A Dutch green activist investor group, Follow This, has dropped its petition for Exxon shareholders to vote on whether the company should set emissions reduction targets after Exxon took legal action against the plans. In a surprise move, the company filed a complaint at a US district court in Texas last month, which sought to prevent the activists from putting new climate targets to a vote at the company’s shareholder meeting in May. It was the first time Exxon had sought a legal route to block shareholder activists, and the move was understood to have been closely watched by US corporations and shareholders. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “Given Exxon’s preference to fight a battle in court rather than allow shareholders the freedom of a vote at its annual meeting, we decided to withdraw the climate proposal. Now that we have withdrawn, the company has no reason to continue the lawsuit.” Exxon argued that the Follow This proposal, which it put forward alongside Arjuna Capital, violated the SEC’s investor petition rules, which are designed to prevent shareholders being able to “micromanage” businesses’ decisions through proposals. The company said that Follow This and Arjuna were “driven by an extreme agenda” and that their proposals were “calculated to diminish the company’s existing business”. Exxon reported one of its largest annual profits of the last decade of $36bn (about £28.4bn) for 2023, which was the second-highest profit only to its $55.7bn profit for the year before. The 35% slump in profit was due to falling oil and gas market prices which peaked in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The global oil price averaged about $81 a barrel last year compared with $100 a barrel the year before. Exxon has come under fire for producing more oil and gas despite warnings from experts around the urgent need to tackle the climate crisis. It has set a goal to reduce emissions from its own operations to net zero by 2050. But unlike other western oil companies, it has stopped short of setting reduction targets for the emissions created by burning its oil and gas, known as scope 3 emissions. The company said: “We are simply asking the court to apply the SEC’s proxy rules as written to stop this abuse and eliminate the significant resources required to address them.” The SEC has come under pressure from some companies for allowing environmental groups to register what they believe to be too many motions at annual shareholder meetings, after it revoked policies adopted by the Trump administration.", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Prof Donald Rothwell, who specialises in international law at the Australian National University, said Bass Strait was used for international navigation and had special status under the UN convention on the law of the sea and related International Maritime Organisation guidelines. As a party to the Unclos, Australia was obliged to remove all structures from Bass Strait when they were no longer in use, he said. Unclos and related IMO guidelines were “unambiguously clear”, Rothwell said: structures in an international strait within Australia’s exclusive economic zone couldn’t be left “in situ”. “There’s actually an obligation to remove those structures,” he said. When decommissioning its 50-year-old fossil fuel infrastructure in the Gippsland basin, located up to 77km off Victoria’s Gippsland coast, ExxonMobil proposed to leave steel structures below depths of 55m “in place on the seabed”. In a September update, the company said lower sections of steel structures in deep water would remain, with removal “part of a future decommissioning campaign, unless an alternative end state is proposed and accepted by the regulator”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority said full removal was “the base case for decommissioning” unless it was satisfied that environmental risks and impacts could be reduced “to as low as reasonably practicable and an acceptable level” in an accepted environment plan. ExxonMobil plans to submit its plan in early 2025. Separate approval would be required from the federal environment department under the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act to abandon any infrastructure on the seabed. “This is a novel issue that hasn’t arisen legally in Australia before,” Rothwell said. He added that the government was well aware of the importance of the UN convention, as well as Australia’s rights and obligations. “We’re in this interesting position at the moment where the prime minister, the defence minister and the foreign minister constantly reference the law of the sea convention in many different settings, mostly in the context of disputations in the South China Sea and the freedom of navigation.” He said the situation raised questions about whether the government would uphold its own obligations under the convention in relation to the offshore oil and gas industry. The Wilderness Society sought Rothwell’s legal opinion after ExxonMobil stated its intention to resubmit plans to leave steel structures in the ocean to Nopsema and the federal environment department. The Wilderness Society campaigner Fern Cadman said Rothwell’s advice demonstrated a clear requirement under international law for the government and its offshore regulator to insist on full removal. “Nopsema needs to crack the whip on ExxonMobil to avoid a scenario where the company no longer has financial capacity for clean up and taxpayers are left meeting Australia’s legal requirement and footing the bill,” Cadman said. Over the next 30 years as projects reach their end of life, an estimated 5.7m tonnes of material – equivalent to 110 Sydney Harbour Bridges – needs to be removed from Australian offshore oil and gas facilities, according to the Centre of Decommissioning Australia. As Australia’s first major offshore oil and gas development, the Gippsland basin was among the first and largest to face decommissioning. ExxonMobil’s wholly owned subsidiary Esso Australia operated and managed the Bass Strait assets in the Gippsland basin on behalf of the company’s joint ventures with Woodside Energy and Mitsui E&amp;P Australia. A company spokesperson said it was “progressively decommissioning” its Gippsland basin facilities, including plugging and abandoning more than 120 wells, and contracting a vessel to begin removing topsides and upper jacket sections to 55m deep in 2027-28. “Esso is currently evaluating a range of decommissioning options including full removal, partial removal and leaving in situ with respect to environmental impacts and risks that may arise, as well as technical, safety and socioeconomic aspects,” the spokesperson said.", "section": "Environment", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The company hopes to stop investors voting on a motion put forward by Follow This, a Dutch green activist investor group, which called for Exxon to accelerate its attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The company filed the lawsuit at a US district court in Texas on Sunday, arguing that the proposal violates SEC investor petition rules. It asked the court to make a decision by 19 March, before its annual meeting on 29 May. The move will be followed closely by other oil and gas companies and green groups, as environmental campaigners attempt to hold the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies to account for their emissions. Follow This, which put the motion forward with the investment adviser Arjuna Capital, has registered motions at a series of oil companies’ annual general meetings for years, in a campaign to tighten their commitments to reducing their emissions. Shell is facing a rebellion from investors that own about 5% of its shares over a Follow This resolution at this year’s AGM, after a chaotic meeting disrupted by green campaigners last year. It is unclear whether Exxon also sent a “no action letter” to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the typical route taken by listed companies attempting to stop a vote on a resolution. The company has argued that the Follow This and Arjuna proposal breaks the US regulator’s rules designed to prevent shareholders being able to “micromanage” businesses’ decisions through proposals. The SEC has come under pressure for allowing environmental groups to register too many motions at annual shareholder meetings, after it revoked policies adopted by the Donald Trump administration. Last year, ExxonMobil announced it planned to reach net zero by 2050 for greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations. In 2021, an activist hedge fund, Engine No 1, won three seats on Exxon’s board at its annual meeting after demanding it reduced its emissions more quickly. An Exxon spokesperson said: “The breakdown of the shareholder proposal process, one that allows proponents to advance their agendas through a flood of proposals, does not serve the interests of investors. “We are simply asking the court to apply the SEC’s proxy rules as written to stop this abuse and eliminate the significant resources required to address them.” Mark van Baal, of Follow This, said: “With this remarkable step, ExxonMobil clearly wants to prevent shareholders using their rights. Apparently, the board fears shareholders will vote in favour of emissions reductions targets. We don’t know why ExxonMobil took this remarkable step.” In the UK, ExxonMobil’s subsidiary Esso Petroleum Company (EPC) owns the Fawley oil refinery in Hampshire as well as a fuel distribution business. There are 1,200 Esso branded forecourts in the UK, of which 197 are company owned. Accounts filed at Companies House this month showed EPC’s pre-tax profits surged from £150m in 2021 to £864m, while turnover more than doubled, from £6.3bn to £13.7bn. The group’s UK operations paid a £440m dividend to its US parent in September 2023, the accounts show. “Turnover was significantly higher due to the economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic, driving up both volumes and prices,” the directors said. EPC’s gross emissions in 2022 increased by more than 5% to 2.81m tonnes of CO2 equivalent, up from 2.66m in 2021.", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Hampshire’s participation in the GSL comes despite their venue’s public commitment to playing a leading global role in environmental sustainability. The Utilita Bowl celebrated switching on more than 1,000 solar panels before a T20 between England and Australia in September. David Mann, chief executive of the Utilita Bowl, used the initiative to highlight “our commitment to being the greenest international cricket venue”. The new five-team GSL tournament runs from 26 November to 6 December and, alongside the Australian state team Victoria, features the franchise sides Guyana Amazon Warriors, Lahore Qalandars and Rangpur Riders. ExxonMobil Guyana is its title sponsor, with the tournament website stating the event “has the full support of the Government of Guyana … the government sees the GSL as a key driver for tourism and economic growth”. ExxonMobil found oil in the country in 2015 and, this month, celebrated the production of 500m barrels from the Stabroek block. Etienne Stott, an Olympic gold medallist in 2012 who now campaigns for Extinction Rebellion, told the Guardian: “I’m really sad and angry that yet another sport is being corrupted by the oily money of the fossil fuel industry.” Stott said it was “perverse” for ExxonMobil to sponsor “a supposedly global cricket tournament in a country which is very much at risk from the effects of global heating. “I cannot understand why Hampshire [County] Cricket Club would risk reputational damage by associating itself with such an obvious sportswashing vehicle, especially given their public commitments to be more sustainable,” said Stott. “I hope cricket fans will demand that this tournament ditches its filthy sponsor.” Hampshire have declined to comment. Joe Cooke, an environmental campaigner and ex-professional cricketer for Glamorgan, said: “It’s disheartening to see cricket being sponsored and influenced by companies with such a direct link to the climate crisis. As a sport we are deeply at mercy to the environment with extreme weather events that have been made more likely by a changing climate, impacting the game at all levels. Cricket could be in a unique position to set a positive example by distancing itself from these kinds of partnerships.” ExxonMobil also sponsors the Amazon Warriors, who play in the Caribbean Premier League, and its involvement in cricket highlights the significant relationship between fossil fuel firms and the sport. In May the International Cricket Council announced a four-year extension to its partnership with Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil company. Chris Britt-Searle of The Next Test, a group aiming to raise awareness of the climate crisis’s impact on cricket, said: “It’s very easy to condemn individual teams, countries and competitions. But the truth is, the whole of cricket is awash with fossil fuel money.” Britt-Searle added that the tournament could be an “opportunity” for cricketers to discuss the involvement of fossil fuels in cricket, noting the recent letter signed by more than 100 female professional footballers urging Fifa to end its partnership with Aramco. “I would say to all cricketers, all cricket fans, clubs, cricket organisations, you have an opportunity to talk about this,” said Britt-Searle. “There’s a great opportunity here to put your hand up and say: ‘Look, we’re not OK with this.’”", "section": "Sport", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The researchers said the 2023 data strengthened the case for holding fossil fuel companies to account for their contribution to global heating. Previous versions of the annual report have been used in legal cases against companies and investors. The report found that the 36 major fossil fuel companies, including Saudi Aramco, Coal India, ExxonMobil, Shell and numerous Chinese companies, produced coal, oil and gas responsible for more than 20bn tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2023. If Saudi Aramco was a country, it would be the fourth biggest polluter in the world after China, the US and India, while ExxonMobil is responsible for about the same emissions as Germany, the world’s ninth biggest polluter, according to the data. Global emissions must fall by 45% by 2030 if the world is to have a good chance of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C, the internationally agreed target. However, emissions are still rising, supercharging the extreme weather that is taking lives and livelihoods across the planet. The International Energy Agency has said new fossil fuel projects started after 2021 are incompatible with reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Most of the 169 companies in the Carbon Majors database increased their emissions in 2023, which was the hottest year on record at the time. “These companies are keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels with no plans to slow production,” said Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief when the landmark 2015 Paris agreement was delivered. “The science is clear: we cannot move backwards to more fossil fuels and more extraction. Instead, we must move forward to the many possibilities of a decarbonised economic system that works for people and the planet.” Emmett Connaire, at InfluenceMap, the thinktank that produced the Carbon Majors report, said: “Despite global climate commitments, a small group of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers are significantly increasing production and emissions. The research highlights the disproportionate impact these companies have on the climate crisis and supports efforts to enforce corporate responsibility.” A spokesperson for Shell said: “Shell is committed to becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers.” Saudi Aramco declined to comment. Coal India, ExxonMobil, Chevron, TotalEnergies and BP did not respond to requests for comment. The Carbon Majors data has been used as evidence supporting laws passed in New York and Vermont states in the US, which seek compensation from fossil fuel companies for climate damages. The data has also been cited by legal groups as support for potential criminal charges against fossil fuel executives and referenced in regulatory actions, such as ClientEarth’s complaint against BlackRock for misleading investors. The Carbon Majors report calculates the emissions released by the burning of the coal, oil and gas produced by 169 major companies in 2023. The database also includes emissions from the production of cement, which rose by 6.5% in 2023. The 36 companies responsible for half of global emissions in 2023 includes state-owned companies such as China Energy, the National Iranian Oil Company, Russia’s Gazprom and the UAE’s Adnoc. Shareholder-owned companies in that group include Petrobras, headquartered in Brazil, and Eni, from Italy. The 36 companies are dominated by state-owned enterprises, of which there are 25. Ten of these are in China, the world’s biggest polluting country. Coal was the source of 41% of the emissions counted in 2023, oil 32%, gas 23% and cement 4%. The Carbon Majors dataset also includes historical emission from 1854 to 2023. It shows that two-thirds of carbon emissions from fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution are from 180 companies, 11 of which no longer exist. Kumi Naidoo, the president of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: “We are living at a critical moment in human history. It is essential that governments step up and use their authority to end the root cause of the crisis we find ourselves in: the expansion of fossil fuels.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Several of the top spenders on activities to influence EU policymaking are on the payroll of oil and gas companies, according to an analysis of the EU Transparency Register by the Good Lobby nonprofit, but fossil fuel clients represent just 1% of the industry’s revenue. The researchers said it showed that public affairs companies could cut ties with the big polluters who pay them to influence policy without hurting their bottom lines – but warned there was little public or regulatory pressure on lobbyists to go green. Alberto Alemanno, the founder of the Good Lobby and a co-author of the research, said public affairs companies lobbying on behalf of the fossil fuel industry had flown under the radar. “They can afford to keep [these clients] – even though they bring in very little – because they have basically not been subject to any form of accountability.” In the first comprehensive review of lobbying firms working for oil and gas companies, which was shared exclusively with the Guardian, the researchers created a database of public affairs and law firms, as well as their clients, using disclosures made on the EU transparency register before January 2024. They tallied the midpoint of the lobbying costs, which the register publishes only in ranges, to estimate the amount of money each company receives from fossil fuel clients. The list does not include fossil fuel industry groups or secondary polluters, such as airlines and carmakers. Some of the companies have deepened their ties with big oil over the last year, according to checks conducted by the Guardian using disclosures made as of April 2025. Several have also made public sustainability commitments that appear to contrast with the actions of their clients, such as energy companies who have scrapped climate targets or shown little progress towards reducing emissions. Burson, Cohn &amp; Wolfe, a public affairs company, is listed as having taken €600,000-699,999 from ExxonMobil Petroleum and Chemical in 2024 for lobbying services on several environment files. Burson says on its website “we help energy clients navigate the transition toward sustainable progress”. Another company, FTI Consulting, is listed as having taken €300,000-399,999 from ConocoPhillips and €50,000-99,999 from ExxonMobil in 2023, the latest year for which it has disclosed clients. Its latest sustainability report says: “FTI Consulting’s role as a professional services firm allows us to support a sustainable economy – both through our internal initiatives and the work we do on behalf of our clients.” A third company, Nove, is listed as having taken €100,000-199,999 from ExxonMobil and €100,000-199,999 from Equinor in 2024, as well as smaller sums from ENI, TotalEnergies and SNAM. A case study on Nove’s website says it helped a client prevent the European Commission from banning “critical chemicals” in a regulatory proposal to reduce climate-damaging fluorinated gas emissions. It says: “We brought our client’s position and demonstrative data to the attention of the co-legislators, successfully creating room for an exemption for safe closed-loop use of fluorinated gases without economically or chemically viable substitutions.” The researchers said they wanted to shine a light on enablers of pollution who provide services for the fossil fuel industry but escape public attention. Similar efforts have helped spur change in the advertising industry, with the Clean Creatives movement covering more than 1,300 agencies who openly refuse to work with fossil fuel clients. Duncan Meisel, the executive director of Clean Creatives, said dropping fossil clients was a smart business strategy for public affairs firms because it would help them advocate for all companies in their portfolio – including those that would be hit hard by climate breakdown. It would also help them attract and retain talent, such as young graduates who see the climate crisis as an existential threat, and avoid potential crackdowns by regulators, he added. Public affairs firms are just one avenue by which energy companies seek to sway European policymakers. Many of the biggest players employ large teams of lobbyists in Brussels or work through well-connected industry associations that have the ear of EU officials and ministers in national governments. As a result, a naming-and-shaming campaign may only have limited effect on climate policy, industry insiders say. Fossil fuel companies have already made efforts to develop lobbying capabilities in-house, and a climate-driven rift in the industry would probably drive those that have not yet done so to the lobbying firms that choose to continue working with them. But such a shift would still make it more difficult for polluters to stand in the way of climate action, said Meisel. “Even if fossil fuel companies completely in-house their lobbying, they’ll have to pull from a dwindling pool of talent that is not interested in devoting their whole careers to polluters. “Generally speaking, fossil fuel companies are not high-prestige clients. They don’t win awards, they don’t get listed prominently on resume sites, and they don’t offer a long-term career path. Polluter agencies will be the agencies with less talent and less impact, and likely higher fees.” Some of the public affairs companies highlighted in the analysis disagreed with the characterisation of their clients as fossil-based. Aula Europe, which is listed as having taken €100,000-199,999 from Neste between April 2022 and March 2023, said its client had transformed from “a local oil refiner into a global leader in renewable and circular solutions”. “Aula’s public affairs work with Neste has focused on renewable energy and EU decarbonisation policies relevant to this transformation,” said Henri Satuli, a lobbyist at Aula Europe. Must and Partners, which is listed as having taken €50,000-99,999 from the Italian energy company A2A in 2024, provided a statement from A2A that disputed its classification as a fossil fuel company, stating: “In 2024, renewables accounted for approximately 50% of the group’s total electricity production, highlighting A2A’s concrete progress toward a cleaner energy model.” The other public affairs businesses named in the analysis – along with Hill and Knowlton, Weber Shandwick, Rud Pedersen, FleishmanHillard and Eupportunity – did not respond to a request for comment. Dieter Zinnbauer, a researcher and adviser to the Good Lobby, said it was telling that many of the public affairs firms highlighted in the analysis focused their public sustainability statements around actions to reduce their direct carbon footprint. “It’s one thing to recycle toner cartridges in your office, that’s great,” he said. “But if your main business line is about helping put the world on the wrong track towards the energy transition, this is more consequential in terms of what you’re doing than the recycling you do on the side.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Amazon, Tesla, Meta, ExxonMobil, Blackstone, Vanguard and Glencore are the corporations included in the report. The companies’ lobbying arms are attempting to shape global policy at the United Nations Summit of the Future in New York City on 22 and 23 September. At Amazon, the report notes the company’s size and role as the fifth largest employer in the world and the largest online retailer and cloud computing service, has had a profound impact on the industries and communities it operates within. “The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level,” states the report. The report cites Amazon’s high injury rates in the US, the company challenging the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), its efforts in Canada to overturn labor law, the banning of Amazon lobbyists from the European parliament for refusing to attend hearings on worker violations, and refusal to negotiate with unions in Germany, among other cases. Amazon has also funded far-right political groups’ efforts to undermine women’s rights and antitrust legislation, and its retail website has been used by hate groups to raise money and sell products. At Tesla, the report cites anti-union opposition by the company in the US, Germany, and Sweden; human rights violations within its supply chains; and Elon Musk’s personal opposition to unions and democracy, challenges to the NLRB in the US, and his support for the political leaders Donald Trump, Javier Milei in Argentina and Narendra Modi in India. The report cites Meta, the largest social media company in the world, for its vast role in permitting and enabling far-right propaganda and movements to use its platforms to grow members and garner support in the US and abroad. It also cited retaliation from the company for regulatory measures in Canada, and expensive lobbying efforts against laws to regulate data privacy. Glencore, the largest mining company in the world by revenue, was included in the report for its role in financing campaigns globally against Indigenous communities and activists. Blackstone, the private equity firm led by Stephen Schwarzman, a billionaire backer of Donald Trump, was cited in the report for its roles in funding far-right political movements, investments in fossil fuel projects and deforestation in the Amazon. “Blackstone’s network has spent tens of millions of dollars supporting politicians and political forces who promise to prevent or eliminate regulations that might hold it to account,” the report noted. Blackstone has disputed the Amazon deforestation claim and sold its remaining shares in the company in question in 2021. The company argued it does not make direct political contributions and that contributions from its executives are personal. The Vanguard Group was included in the report due to its role in financing some of the world’s most anti-democratic corporations. ExxonMobil was cited for funding anti-climate science research and aggressive lobbying against environmental regulations. Even in “robust democracies” workers’ demands “are overwhelmed by corporate lobbying operations, either in policymaking or the election in itself”, said Todd Brogan, director of campaigns and organizing at the ITUC. “This is about power, who has it, and who sets the agenda. We know as trade unionists that unless we’re organized, the boss sets the agenda in the workplace, and we know as citizens in our countries that unless we’re organized and demanding responsive governments that actually meet the needs of people, it’s corporate power that’s going to set the agenda. “They’re playing the long game, and it’s a game about shifting power away from democracy at every level into one where they’re not concerned about the effects on workers – they’re concerned about maximizing their influence and their extractive power and their profit,” added Brogan. “Now is the time for international and multi-sectoral strategies, because these are, in many cases, multinational corporations that are more powerful than states, and they have no democratic accountability whatsoever, except for workers organized.” The ITUC includes labor group affiliates from 169 nations and territories around the world representing 191 million workers, including the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, and the Trades Union Congress in the UK. With 4 billion people around the world set to participate in elections in 2024, the federation is pushing for an international binding treaty being worked on by the Open-ended intergovernmental working group to hold transnational corporations accountable under international human rights laws.

This is the result of a new peer-review study published in the journal Nature that sought to establish a method that would allow courts to quantify the economic loss caused by fossil fuel producers for one kind of climate impact – extreme heat. Looking at the period 1991 to 2020, the researchers, Christopher Callahan at Stanford University in California and Justin Mankin at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, used historical emissions data for the world’s five biggest oil producers: BP, Gazprom, Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil and Chevron. They then sought to understand how the emissions from these companies contributed to extreme heat. This was defined as the temperature of the hottest five days in a year. The team developed a replicable method to quantify the damage linked to a single company, with the figure running into the trillions for the world’s largest fossil fuel producers. It suggested state-owned oil companies Saudi Aramco and Gazprom were responsible for US$2.05tr and $2tr in damages respectively. Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP were each found to be responsible for $1.98tr, $1.91tr and $1.45tr in losses respectively. In a separate analysis of emissions data for five major Australian resource companies – BHP, Rio Tinto, Santos, Whitehaven Coal and Woodside Energy – Callahan assessed the total damages from their collective emissions at more than US$600bn, or A$929.47bn. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “Our analysis is very explicitly thinking about emissions that are already occurred and the sort of historical changes in extreme heat, and attributing those to emissions that have been already detected and attributed to specific actors,” Callahan said. “Even just from that we get numbers in the trillions, when you aggregate globally over the last 30 years in terms of the losses associated with any individual company, but GDP growth losses from extreme heat are a very small fraction of the total cost of climate change.” The difficulty in establishing causation and calculating a single company’s contribution to climate harms has made courts in many jurisdictions, particularly in Australia, reluctant to hold individual fossil fuel producers to account for the climate impact of their projects. When seeking approval to build and operate its $5.6bn Barossa gasfield in a remote area off the far north Australian coast, Australian oil company Santos was asked by the Australian Conservation Foundation whether it had considered potential climate harms. Santos responded by arguing “there are limitations to linking emissions from the activity to any specific climate change impacts”. “Santos invited ACF to provide further information regarding how it is able to undertake an analysis that links climate change impacts from the activity to specific environments or ecosystems,” the company said. Callahan said the work provides a foundation for future research to link the activities of specific oil, gas and coal producers to additional climate harms such as drought, flooding and sea level rise, though he added there was still “a long way to go” before a tobacco or asbestos-style lawsuit succeeds. “Until two weeks ago, it was unclear whether it was scientifically supported to say an individual emitter can be linked to the impact that you’re suing over or that you are trying to recoup costs for. That scientific connection can absolutely be made,” he said. “It is no longer scientifically supported for actors to argue that there is plausible deniability, that it is impossible to link any of an individual actor to any impact of climate change. “That statement, that there is a sort of uncrossable gap between where you emit and some other impact down the road, we’ve shown that to be fallacious.” Several significant lawsuits have been brought against major US oil companies, including Municipalities of Puerto Rico v Exxon Mobil Corp and other cases brought by individual US state governments. On Friday, Hawaii became the 10th US state to take fossil fuel producers to court over alleged climate deception, prompting a countersuit by the Trump administration in an attempt to block the filing. Next to the United States, Australia is the second most active jurisdiction in the world for climate litigation, according to Melbourne Law School’s Climate Change litigation database which currently tracks 627 cases. Many of these cases include smaller decisions involving council planning, regulations or access to information as the database uses a broader definition.", "section": "Environment", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Juliana Leon died of hyperthermia in Seattle at age 65 during the 2021 Pacific north-west heat dome – an event that killed nearly 200 people, and which meteorologists say would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused global warming. “The day Julie died was the hottest day ever recorded in Washington with temperatures in Seattle, where Julie died, peaking around 108F,” reads the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday by Misti Leon, Juliana Leon’s daughter Because they failed to warn the public about the dangers of planet-heating emissions, major fossil fuel companies should be held accountable for that death, the case argues. “When a tragedy like Julie’s death results from the prolific use of fossil fuels, it is easy to dismiss the misfortune as an accident rather than a foreseeable consequence of Defendants’ deception,” the lawsuit says. It names ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and the BP-managed subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company as defendants. The Guardian has contacted each of the companies named in the suit for comment. Shell and Phillips 66 declined to comment. The new lawsuit represents a new frontier for climate accountability litigation, following dozens of lawsuits brought by cities and states against big oil in recent years. Previous suits accused companies of breaching product liability and consumer protection laws and engaging in fraud and racketeering. But Wednesday’s case is the first attempt to hold oil companies responsible for an individual climate-related death. “Lethal climate disasters are the foreseeable, and foreseen, consequences of specific actions by fossil fuel corporations, CEOs and boards of directors,” Aaron Regunberg, a director at the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. “They caused the climate crisis and deceived the public about the dangerousness of their products in order to block and delay solutions that could prevent heat deaths like Juliana’s.” The new lawsuit is a civil case, but Regunberg has spent years asserting that prosecutors could also bring criminal charges against big oil, including homicide. A 2023 report published in Harvard’s Environmental Law Review argued that oil companies could be charged with every kind of homicide charge, other than first-degree murder. “Big oil’s victims deserve accountability,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, which tracks and supports climate accountability litigation, in a statement. “This is an industry that is causing and accelerating climate conditions that kill people. They’ve known it for 50 years, and at some point they must be held accountable.”", "section": "US news", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The president raised a stunning $239m for his inauguration – more than the previous three inaugural committees took in combined and more than double the previous record – according to data published by the US Federal Election Commission (FEC). The oil and gas sector made a significant contribution to that overall number, found the international environmental and human rights organization Global Witness. The group pulled itemized inaugural fund contribution data released by the FEC in April, and researched each contributor with the help of an in-house artificial intelligence tool. It located 47 contributions to the fund made by companies and individuals linked to the fossil fuel sector, to which Trump has voiced his fealty. On the campaign trail and in his inauguration speech, the president pledged to “drill, baby, drill”. “We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it,” Trump said in his inaugural address, just hours before he signed a spate of executive orders to “unleash American energy” and roll back environmental protections. His administration has since worked to boost the oil industry, including by taking aim at city- and state-led fossil fuel accountability efforts, opening up swaths of land to extraction, and cracking down on renewable energy expansion. “It’s no surprise the oil and gas industry handed millions to Donald Trump for his inauguration, and they seem to have reaped a huge return on their investment, said Nicu Calcea, a senior data investigator at Global Witness. Among the oil-linked donors identified, the energy giant Chevron made the largest contribution to Trump’s inaugural fund at $2m, tying it for fourth-largest donor overall alongside other givers such as the crypto platform Coinbase and the financial services company Robinhood. Reached for comment, a Chevron spokesperson said: “Chevron has a long tradition of celebrating democracy by supporting the inaugural committees of both parties. We are proud to have done so again.” ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum each made $1m donations. None of the three companies responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment. Altogether, Global Witness identified $19,151,933 in donations from fossil fuel-linked donors. That number is probably an underestimate, it says, because it does not include contributions from unverified energy-linked donors, or from diversified investors and businesses that do not work primarily in oil and gas. Trump’s profile of inaugural fund donors starkly contrasts with Joe Biden’s; the former president banned contributions to the fund from the oil and gas sector. “So Trump’s day one love-in with the oil and gas industry really tells us whose side he’s on,” said Alice Harrison, head of fossil fuel campaigning at Global Witness. Set up as charitable organizations, presidential inaugural funds are used to cover the costs of parades, galas and receptions as a new president enters the White House. Unlike presidential election campaigns, there are no set limits on how much a corporation or US citizen can give to an inaugural committee. Fossil fuel interests poured an additional $96m into Trump’s re-election campaign and affiliated political action committees, a January report found. Though that was less than the $1bn he requested from the sector in an infamous meeting at his Mar-a-Lago club last spring, it still constituted record levels of spending.", "section": "US news", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Advanced recycling, also known as chemical recycling, refers to a variety of processes used to break plastics into their constituent molecules. The industry has increasingly promoted these technologies, as public concern about the environmental and health effects of plastic pollution has grown. Yet the rollout of these technologies has been plagued by problems, according to a new analysis from the Center for Climate Integrity (CCI), a fossil-fuel accountability advocacy group. “The companies make it sound like it’s pretty great, like it’s something we should pursue,” said Davis Allen, investigative researcher at the CCI and author of the report. “But they know the problems, the limitations.” The new analysis follows a 2024 CCI report which alleged that plastic producers concealed the problems with traditional recycling, and argued that they could face legal ramifications for doing so. That earlier research was cited in a September lawsuit filed by California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, against ExxonMobil for its role in the plastic pollution crisis. “The new report focuses on this modern deception with advanced recycling, which has become a real focus for the industry in recent years,” said Davis. Companies have depicted advanced recycling as groundbreaking and new. A 2020 video from Chevron Phillips, a joint venture between Chevron and Phillips 66, calls it a “revolutionary innovation that can turn a piece of plastic into a new material again and again and again”. Three years later, ExxonMobil’s CEO, Darren Woods, called the technology “brand new” in an interview, the report notes. The air of newness has been echoed by publications and politicians. However, though there have been some new technological innovations, chemical recycling processes were patented as early as the 1950s, and have been touted as a solution to plastic waste by trade groups since the 1970s. Back in 1977, for instance, a brochure from the Society of the Plastics Industry trade group claimed that the most common form of advanced recycling, pyrolysis, would allow plastic waste to be “recycled into feedstocks that can be used again to make new plastics”, the report notes. Asked to comment on the research, an ExxonMobil spokesperson, Michelle Gray, said: “Advanced recycling is a proven technology – one which the EU recognizes as a solution to plastic waste. We’ve processed more than 80m pounds of plastic at our Baytown facility since startup that might otherwise have gone to landfills.” Matthew Kastner, a spokesperson for top US chemical trade group American Chemistry Council, which represents plastic producers, said: “Activist groups who claim advanced recycling ‘isn’t real’ appear to be ignoring science, innovation and measurable results. “Reports built on selective data and anti-plastic agendas do nothing to advance real environmental progress,” he said, adding: “Groups like the Center for Climate Integrity … who claim expertise on advanced recycling despite likely never having visited a facility, were founded to dismantle the petrochemical industry in the United States, killing thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in tax revenue.” Chevron Phillips declined to comment. The Society of the Plastics Industry did not respond to a request for comment. Though they have existed for decades, these technologies have still not been realized at scale because they face strong limitations. Though they do not seem to mention them in ads or public relations campaigns, the industry has long been familiar with those problems, the report says. One major issue: the processes are expensive, requiring large amounts of energy, fuel and labor. In 1991, a market research firm said the “economics of these processes has not been demonstrated”, and at a 1994 trade meeting, Exxon Chemical vice-president Irwin Levowitz called pyrolysis “fundamentally uneconomical”, the analysis says. In an emailed comment, Exxon’s Gray said: “The technology makes sense, which is why we’ve invested more than $200m to expand advanced recycling operations and aim to continue doing so both in the US and in Europe.” The industry has failed to highlight not only the economic challenges of advanced recycling, but also its technical limitations, Allen argues. The industry group America’s Plastic Makers – part of the American Chemistry Council trade group – for instance, has often claimed the processes can transform plastic waste into “brand new plastic”. And in 2023, the energy giant Shell claimed in a video that chemical recycling can process plastics “used in many places like homes, hospitals, transportation, construction, agriculture and electronics”. However, many chemical recycling facilities do not turn plastic into new plastic; rather, they produce only fuel. “That undermines the claim that they’re creating a circular economy – it’s not circular if you’re not using the materials to make new plastic,” said Allen. Further, post-consumer items cannot easily be processed with advanced recycling, the report says. The process works best with clean, homogeneous inputs, and since sorting and cleaning consumer products is expensive, many facilities working at scale process mostly clean, un-dyed industrial waste. It’s an issue raised in California’s 2024 lawsuit against Exxon. In an email, the American Chemistry Council’s Kastner said: “I’ve seen firsthand post-consumer mixed plastics from MRFs be fed into the processing systems of an advanced recycling facility.” //moved up In response to a request for comment about the research, Shell spokesperson Natalie Gunnell said: “Shell supports advancing circularity of plastics globally. We encourage reduction, reuse and recycling of plastics and are working across the plastics value chain to expand the development of waste handling and recycling technologies for greater circularity.” Another problem the industry does not frequently address publicly: the pollution caused by advanced recycling. Though “the plastics industry positions advanced recycling as an environmentally friendly solution for plastic waste”, the report says, the processes emit toxic and planet-warming pollutants. The industry acknowledges this fact internally, the report says, noting a 2024 report from consulting firm Roland Berger which addresses advanced recycling’s “substantial” carbon footprint, and a 2023 industry presentation from engineering firm AMI Consulting which said the environmental effects of the technologies “need to be taken seriously”. The Guardian has asked Roland Berger for comment. The limitations of advanced recycling generally go unmentioned in public by companies, but have long been raised by environmentalists. Privately, industry interests have given credence to those concerns. “The concerns of industry critics are, in many cases, justified,” one industry consultant explained at a 2023 conference sponsored by the American Chemistry Council trade group, the report notes. It is possible that the new research could inspire additional litigation, but its main purpose is to inform the public, said Allen. “The information ecosystem around advanced recycling is totally dominated by the industry itself,” Allen said. “Our hope is that our work gives people the tools they need to break down and assess the industry’s claims.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Oil and gas giants such as Equinor, BP, and ExxonMobil attended 24 of 44 external ministerial meetings to discuss carbon capture and storage (CCS) in 2023, according to official transparency records. That represented a surge in activity relative to 2020-22, when ministers held about half as many meetings to discuss the technology, and oil and gas companies would attend seven to 10 of these discussions each year. During a call in December with three Equinor executives, one of the company’s team told Jeremy Allen, then director of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), that Equinor “appreciate[d] the … collaborative approach to policy development”. In a meeting in March last year, an ExxonMobil executive from the company’s “low carbon solutions” division “spoke of the outstanding need for oil and gas, at the same time as needing to lower emissions”, according to meeting notes obtained by environmental journalism site DeSmog through freedom of information requests. The growing engagement by oil and gas companies has sharpened concerns among climate advocates that industry is skewing the UK’s carbon capture strategy to preserve demand for fossil gas – a significant source of planet-heating carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane emissions. “Fossil fuel companies often have the engineering knowhow to build these projects, so the government naturally has to meet with them,” said Laurie Laybourn, an environmental policy researcher and associate fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank. “But that might create a risk whereby these companies unduly influence policy and rollout in a way that benefits them.” Other sectors engaging frequently with ministers on CCS policy include heavy manufacturing companies, CCS technology firms, lobby groups and investment funds. Researchers, climate advocacy groups and local councils were less well represented, the transparency records showed. No individual organisation from these sectors has attended more than three meetings with ministers on carbon capture since the start of 2020. Meanwhile, lobby group the Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA) – which represents dozens of fossil fuel companies – attended 20 meetings, and Equinor 16. BP, ExxonMobil, Scottish power company SSE, and Drax, a biomass power plant that is one of the UK’s biggest emitters, also attended nine meetings each during the same period. The new Labour government announced plans last week to extend £22bn in subsidies for carbon capture over 25 years, saying the strategy can help meet the country’s climate targets and support broader revitalisation of British industry. The policy builds on the previous Conservative government’s plans to establish four CCS “clusters”, where carbon capture would be used to trap some of the CO2 emitted by fossil-fuel burning factories and power plants. Pipelines would then carry the captured gas underground to be stored in depleted oil and gas reservoirs under the North and Irish Seas. The government’s plans include proposals by Equinor and BP – two of the companies that have met ministers most frequently since January 2020 – to build new “low-carbon” gas-fired power stations fitted with carbon capture units, which are slated to be among the first to receive state support. A group of scientists and campaigners said last month that such projects would allow the companies to continue extracting and burning natural gas based on the promises of unproved and expensive carbon capture technology – at the taxpayer’s expense. “Putting the UK on the wrong pathway could be catastrophic,” said the letter, addressed to the new energy secretary, Ed Miliband. Carbon Tracker, a financial thinktank, said in a March report that building new gas-fired power plants “could lock consumers into a high-cost and fossil-based future” and urged the UK to focus on deploying carbon capture in hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as cement. “These ‘low-carbon’ gas projects are not really low carbon if you look at the whole supply chain,” said the report’s author, Lorenzo Sani. “They also continue this paradigm that we have today of linking our economies with fossil fuels, whose markets are volatile and often controlled by external actors to the UK.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and International Energy Agency envisage significant deployments of carbon capture for reaching net zero emissions by mid-century. However, many environmental groups are sceptical. Researchers point to the frequent failure of projects to meet carbon capture targets, cost-overruns, the need for multi-billion dollar subsidies, and the tendency of the oil and gas industry to use the technology to justify investments in new fossil fuel projects — rather than focus on cleaning up existing dirty industries. Nevertheless, oil and gas companies have continued to press the case to ministers that gas-fired power plants fitted with carbon capture can be a climate solution. The surge in lobbying coincided with the previous Conservative administration’s pledge in March 2023 of £20bn in subsidies for carbon capture projects, which have struggled to prove economical without state support. Three months after the pledge was announced, lobby group the CCSA told ministers its members were concerned about delays and there was a “struggle to keep investors upbeat”, according to meeting notes. The CCSA has attended 20 government carbon capture meetings, more than any other organisation since January 2020, including two meetings between January and March 2024, the latest period for which records are available. When asked to comment on concerns that their CCS projects may “lock in” fossil fuel dependency, BP and Equinor gave an almost identical statement, saying that CCS was essential for the UK’s transition to net zero and would create jobs. DESNZ said CCS would play a “vital role” in its plans for a clean energy system by 2030. The department also pointed to independent government adviser the Climate Change Committee’s description of carbon capture as a “necessity, not an option”. The CCSA did not respond to requests for comment. Two meetings with ExxonMobil designated for the discussion of “carbon solutions” were used by both the company and the then senior DESNZ minister Graham Stuart to reaffirm the need for continued oil and gas production in the UK, meeting notes show. Stuart told attenders at a meeting on 15 June “that the UK government has championed the need for new oil and gas licences”. An ExxonMobil executive said: “This was important in attracting new investment.” Later in the meeting, minutes show Stuart “reiterated that the government supports the continued development of oil and gas resources on the UK continental shelf”. Four months later, the then Conservative government announced it was granting hundreds of new oil and gas licences in the North Sea. “CCS is technically complex and difficult for anyone but industry experts to fully understand,” said Lindsey Gulden, a former ExxonMobil climate and data scientist. “That means it can be easily spun to give cover to the oil industry as they attempt to navigate the growing public concern over climate change.” ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.

Follow This has confirmed that it will not file any climate resolutions against oil and gas companies during the forthcoming AGM season for the first time since 2016. The Netherlands-based group, which has been one of the most successful shareholder activists of recent years, blamed “the changing political landscape” and “the backlash against climate-conscious investors” for the decision by “most institutional shareholders” to pull their support for climate resolutions. The group pointed to a number of US states which have taken legal action against big investors for supporting climate action, and the recent decision of US regulators to drop climate investment disclosure rules as key factors behind the trend. Follow This was taken to court by ExxonMobil last year for its role in calling for the company to reduce its emissions in line with global climate targets, before a judge threw the case out. The group said that these challenges, combined with global trade tensions, have left investors “uncertain about how to proceed with climate action”. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “Shareholder resolutions have been critical in compelling five oil majors to set emissions-reduction targets, but most institutional investors are reluctant to use their voting power.” He said that the group’s mission would remain unchanged, and it would continue to engage with investors to understand why they do not use their shareholder rights to demand change from the companies they invest in. Follow This holds a small number of shares in oil companies in order to put forward shareholder resolutions which demand that they align their activities with the decarbonisation agenda put forward in the Paris climate agreement. The group’s most notable triumph was a resolution against the board of the US oil company Chevron calling for emissions reductions which won support from 60% of its shareholders at an AGM in 2021. “In 2021, we saw the potential for widespread support,” Van Baal said. “[But] to compel oil giants to make significant investments in clean energy, investor pressure must rise.” Instead, support for the group’s resolutions has plateaued at about 20% in the years since. Van Baal said: “Together with supporting investors, we must convince all responsible investors that they have an unambiguous financial imperative to act. “Big oil can make or break the Paris climate agreement. Their shareholders have only one formal power: the power of the vote. It’s time for more investors to exercise their vote.”", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Yet few media organisations are examining why the climate emergency is creating a new era of demagogues. Even fewer are scrutinising how those authoritarian leaders are trying to misdirect public attention away from the root cause of our current global malaise. The Guardian is different. About nine out of every 10 people in the world want their governments to take stronger climate actions, yet we’ve witnessed a dramatic shift away from the progress we need to avert climate disaster. Powerful governments, financial institutions and big oil companies are turning their back on climate promises and some are funding secretive lobby groups and far-right politicians that want to shift away from the progress we need to make real, positive change. The pushback has been shocking. Debunking climate disinformation is a full-time task for Guardian environment teams across the world, particularly in the United States, now that the world’s biggest fossil fuel producer appears intent on undermining hard-won progress on reducing emissions. The most obvious elements of disinformation are the wild conspiracy theories spread by social media influencers and bots. Instead of attributing disasters to fossil fuels and cuts to emergency services and the US National Weather Service, in July they spread unfounded rumours that the deadly floods in Texas were caused by sinister weather modification technology. In this anything-but-the-truth realm, California wildfires were supposedly planned by officials to destroy child-trafficking tunnels, while the devastation in North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene was apparently the result of a hushed-up dam failure and cloud seeding. Then there are rightwing media organisations that jump to politically convenient – but wrong – interpretations of events, such as the false claims that renewable energy caused the recent massive blackout in Spain. Most alarming are the brazen lies of the likes of Donald Trump, who has called climate science “a giant hoax”, “a scam” and “bullshit”. This is a double falsehood – firstly because climate research is robust and supported by 99.9% of specialists, and secondly because Trump and many of his influential supporters in business and politics are well aware of the global heating risks and are responding in a way that suggests they think their best hope for survival is to build up their wealth, consider invading cooler neighbouring countries, such as Canada and Greenland, and prepare their doomsday bunkers. There also appears to be an insidious strategy to keep people in the dark about the environment for as long as possible. The Guardian has tracked how the Trump administration is defunding world-leading climate research agencies, firing droves of scientists and threatening official portals that were formerly hubs of cutting-edge information about climate trends. Amid so much uncertainty, we published the US National Climate Report in full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain. Worse could still be to come. In the US, Trump has declared an “energy emergency” as an excuse to carve open more land and ocean for oil and gas exploration, which is expected to lead to a sharp increase in US greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel companies, such as Koch Industries, are funding an association of Republican attorneys which includes many Republican attorneys general who are trying to block states seeking compensation for weather disasters caused by climate change. The Orwellian developments in the US have not yet been replicated on the other side of the Atlantic, but Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt to break down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns, despite the very strong public support for both. Earlier this year, the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, and former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss attended the launch of Heartland UK/Europe which is headed by a climate denier and part of a US network funded by the petroleum company ExxonMobil and wealthy US Republican donors. The Guardian has revealed how Heartland has been wooing far-right European politicians since at least February 2023. In these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: the leaders still seeking global solutions, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil” and lobby for compensation for climate damages (which is reminiscent of the Guardian’s earlier Polluters series to name and shame the companies most responsible for the climate emergency), the taskforce dreaming up radical climate solutions, and the campaigns that remind us that the overwhelming majority of people in the world want more ambitious climate action. We are not alone. This is not a fringe issue. Nor is it a hoax or an impossibly expensive challenge, no matter what Silicon Valley social media, Russian bots and Saudi oil money try to tell us.

{"id": "environment/2025/sep/19/revealed-corporate-capture-un-aviation-body-icao", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/19/revealed-corporate-capture-un-aviation-body-icao", "title": "Revealed: ‘Corporate capture’ of UN aviation body by industry", "date": null, "author": "Damian Carrington Environment editor", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "The UN aviation organisation has been captured by the industry, a report has concluded, leading to the urgent action required to tackle the sector’s high carbon emissions being blocked. Industry delegates outnumbered climate experts by 14 to one at the recent “environmental protection” meeting of the UN International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the report found. The ICAO is the forum where nations agree the rules governing international aviation. The analysis, by the thinktank InfluenceMap, concluded that ICAO policies to tackle the climate crisis were weak and reflected the self-interest of powerful members of the aviation industry, such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 350 airlines. ICAO’s assembly, its highest-level summit, held every three years, starts on Tuesday. The report also criticises a lack of transparency compared with other UN organisations, with the meetings where climate policies are developed being closed to the media and requiring delegates to sign non-disclosure agreements. This gives an advantage to groups opposing serious climate action that could otherwise be held publicly accountable, the analysts said. The result of this corporate capture, the report says, is that climate policy for international aviation is judged “critically insufficient” by the independent Climate Action Tracker analysts, aligned with over 4C of global heating. “Our report lays out a clear case of corporate capture,” said Lucca Ewbank, the transport manager at InfluenceMap. “Industry lobbyists continue to dominate decision-making processes at ICAO, relying on closed-door meetings to cement their influence. In order for the aviation sector to meet the existential challenge of climate change, ICAO needs a hard course correction.” Flying causes more climate-heating pollution than any other form of transport per mile and is dominated by rich passengers, with 1% of the world’s population responsible for 50% of aviation emissions. Despite the urgent need for cuts in carbon pollution, ICAO forecasts a doubling of passenger numbers by 2042 and Climate Action Tracker predicts that without strong action, aviation’s carbon dioxide emissions could double or even triple by 2050. The industry argues that more efficient aircraft, sustainable fuels and ICAO’s primary carbon policy, an offsetting scheme, can control carbon emissions. But independent experts say the feasible scale of such measures is extremely unlikely to compensate for such huge growth in air traffic. For example, the “unambitious and problematic” offsetting scheme, called Corsia, has yet to require any airline to use a carbon credit, and fuel-efficiency improvements are stalling. The experts say aviation growth must be curbed if climate targets are to be met. Ewbank said: “Airlines and industry associations are ignoring the warning lights and prioritising industry interests over essential emissions cuts, with only a weak offsetting policy and non-binding targets to show for years of deliberation.” A spokesperson for ICAO said it was committed to increasing transparency as part of a “cultural transformation” launched in 2022. “The ICAO assembly next week will be reviewing progress and determining the next steps. The resolutions passed by the assembly will also support the implementation of ICAO’s long-term strategic plan for 2050, which envisions zero fatalities and net zero carbon emissions. The review of the outcomes and the resulting decisions by the ICAO council and assembly are fully open and broadcast to all.” The spokesperson said developing robust technical standards required detailed input from industry experts and may involve commercially sensitive information that is subject to confidentiality rules. “ICAO strongly urges advocacy by all stakeholders, particularly at a time when air transport is facing its most significant opportunities and challenges,” he said. The InfluenceMap report found that at ICAO’s environmental negotiations in February, 72 delegates (31% of the total) represented industry trade associations, including employees of the fossil fuel companies ExxonMobil and Chevron and the aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing. In contrast, just five delegates (2%) represented green groups. Most of the rest of the delegates (57%) represented countries, although eight of these were also employees of aviation or fossil fuel companies. One of the trade associations, representing aircraft manufacturers, had 41 delegates, more than any national delegation. The dominance of industry interests has grown since the last major environmental meeting in 2022, at which aviation industry delegates outnumbered those from green groups by 10 to one. ICAO and the international aviation industry have set themselves a target of net zero emissions by 2050. But the International Energy Agency found in January that aviation was “not on track” to meet this goal. The InfluenceMap report notes that industry support for the 2050 target appears to be weakening, with the IATA head, Willie Walsh, recently calling for it to be “re-evaluated”, citing concern among airlines about rising costs. The industry failed to meet all but one of 50 of its own climate targets in the past two decades, a 2022 report found. IATA did not respond to requests for comment. Aviation fuel is generally untaxed and new levies to fund climate action are being discussed at high levels. However, in April ICAO called on member states to lobby the UN climate organisation and other bodies to oppose such proposals. ICAO has been widely criticised over its climate policies, even by industry insiders. A group of aviation professionals said in May that the industry was “failing dramatically” in its efforts to tackle its role in the climate crisis. ICAO’s offsetting scheme is also widely criticised. Marte van der Graaf, of the thinktank and campaign group Transport &amp; Environment, said: “Corsia offsets don’t actually reduce emissions. They are often based on dubious ‘avoided deforestation’ schemes based on hypothetical predictions little better than astrology.” IATA warned on Wednesday that there was likely to be a “terrifying” shortfall of approved offsets after the voluntary phase of Corsia ends in 2027. Ewbank said ICAO needed to “prioritise public interests, science-based policies and open negotiations, so that independent experts and civil society can come together with industry in good faith, and so that industry can begin to take real responsibility for the climate impact of the aviation sector”.", "section": "Environment", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The 234 lobbyists from the oil, petrochemical and plastics industries outnumber the combined delegations of all 27 EU member states, and far exceed the number of people attending with the delegation of scientists as well as Indigenous peoples at the Geneva talks. The analysis, from the Centre for International Environmental Law (Ciel), also found 19 lobbyists sit on the national delegations of Egypt, Kazakhstan, China, Iran, Chile and the Dominican Republic. “Fossil fuel companies are central to plastic production, as over 99% of plastics are derived from chemicals sourced from fossil fuels,” said Ximena Banegas, Ciel’s global plastics and petrochemicals campaigner. “After decades of obstruction in the climate negotiations, why would anyone think that they would suddenly show up in good faith in the plastics treaty talks?” The figure was revealed on day three of a two-week resumed meeting to achieve an agreement on the vast global problem of runaway plastic production and waste. The numbers of lobbyists attending the talks has been rising steadily since the process started in 2022, alongside deepening rifts between nations. Negotiations stalled at what was supposed to be the fifth and final round of talks in Busan, South Korea, in December last year. The process was extended to the current round in Switzerland to give nations another chance to agree on a deal. Tensions have flared around key aspects of the proposed treaty, including calls for a production limit on plastics, managing harmful chemicals in plastics, and how the treaty’s implementation will be financed, with countries splitting into increasingly divergent camps. On the one hand is a cohort of more than 100 nations that say they want an ambitious treaty including, among other things, global targets to reduce plastic production. On the other is a small group of oil and plastic-producing states including Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran – the so-called “like-minded group” – that reject production limits and want the treaty to focus on downstream measures to tackle waste. Three days into negotiations, these separate camps seem to be further entrenched, with the United States appearing to side with the industry-friendly “like-minded group”. “They’re basically going full Maga,” said a source close to the talks. “They’re clearly coordinating with Saudi Arabia, Russia and others, because they’re using the same language.” Before the meeting in Geneva, the US reportedly circulated a memo among countries where it openly took a stance against production cuts. The US is the world’s second-largest plastic producer and yet last year said it supported production cuts. The source also noted that the US delegation usually met environmental NGOs, scientists and industry before the talks begin, but that before the Geneva meeting they had met with industry alone. “Even under a Democratic administration, the US is incredibly industry-friendly, but it at least goes through the motions of consulting with its own citizenry,” they said. “That charade is gone now.” Two days before Ciel’s estimate was released, the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA), an industry trade body, released their own statement saying that they had 136 representatives of the plastic, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing industries present at the talks. Referring to their headcount, an ICCA spokesperson said: “We are significantly outnumbered by the more than 1,500 NGO participants.” However, civil society groups say this is a false comparison, as lobbyists have comparatively more power at the talks. Ciel’s analysis shows several lobbyists appear on government delegations from where they can actively sculpt the treaty text. Their impact is also felt on the outside, as even the lobbyists who attend only as negotiation observers – a group that includes industry representatives, civil society organisations and scientists – have “privileged access” to delegates, for example, through industry-sponsored unofficial side events that are common in the margins of the talks. Jo Banner, who is part of the US civil society environmental justice delegation, and lives in Louisiana’s petrochemical industry hub known as “Cancer Alley”, highlights the disconnect between the lobbying work that industry representatives will do in Geneva and the harms that this ultimately leads to on the ground. “This is just a job for them. This is about their 401(k)s and their retirement plans. It’s life or death for us and I don’t want my obituary to be part of their resumé. We’re here fighting to protect our communities. It’s beyond being a job for us.” Last week, Greenpeace released a report showing that seven petrochemical majors – including Dow, ExxonMobil and Shell – have collectively increased their plastic production capacity by 1.4m tonnes since the start of the treaty-making process and have sent a combined total of 70 representatives to the talks. Another factor that may have an effect on the ongoing negotiations is the death in a helicopter accident of the Ghanaian environment minister, Dr Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed, who was due at the meeting alongside more than 70 government ministers next week. Ghana is the chair of the African Group, a 52-nation bloc that has favoured an ambitious treaty from the beginning.

The Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) was set up in 2019 by a group of companies which include ExxonMobil, Dow, Shell, TotalEnergies and ChevronPhillips, some of the world’s biggest producers of plastic. They promised to divert 15m tonnes of plastic waste from the environment in five years to the end of 2023, by improving collection and recycling, and creating a circular economy. Documents from a PR company that were obtained by Greenpeace’s Unearthed team and shared with the Guardian, suggest a key aim of the AEPW was to “change the conversation” away from “simplistic bans of plastic” that were being proposed in 2019 amid an outcry over the scale of plastic pollution leaching into rivers and harming public health. Early last year the alliance target of clearing 15m tonnes of waste plastic was quietly scrapped as “just too ambitious”. The new analysis by energy consultants Wood Mackenzie looked at the plastics output of the five alliance companies; chemical company Dow, which holds the AEPW’s chairmanship, the oil companies ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies, and ChevronPhillips, a joint venture of the US oil giants Chevron and Phillips 66. The data reveals the five companies alone produced 132m tonnes of two types of plastic; polyethylene (PE) and PP (polypropylene) in five years – more than 1,000 times the weight of the 118,500 tonnes of waste plastic the alliance has removed from the environment in the same period. The waste plastic was diverted mostly by mechanical or chemical recycling, the use of landfill, or waste to fuel, AEPW documents state. The amount of plastic produced is likely to be an underestimate as it only covers two of the most widely used polymers; polyethylene which is used for plastic bottles and bags, and polypropylene, used for food packaging. It does not include other major plastics such as polystyrene. The new data was revealed as delegates prepared to meet in Busan, South Korea, to hammer out the world’s first treaty to cut plastic pollution. The treaty has a mandate to agree on a legally binding global agreement to tackle plastic pollution across the entire plastics life cycle. But the talks, which have been subject to heavy lobbying by the alliance and fossil fuel companies, are on a knife-edge in a row over whether caps to global plastic production will be included in the final treaty. Will McCallum, a co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said the revelations had stripped off the thin layer of greenwash hiding the growing mountain of plastic waste oil companies were producing. “The recycling schemes they’re promoting can barely make a dent in all the plastic these companies are pumping out,” he said. “They’re letting the running tap flood the house while trying to scoop up the water with a teaspoon. The only solution is to cut the amount of plastic produced in the first place.” Bill McKibben, a US environmentalist, said: “It’s hard to imagine a clearer example of greenwashing in this world. The oil and gas industry – which is pretty much the same thing as the plastics industry – has been at this for decades.” In response to the allegations a spokesperson for the AEPW said it “respectfully disagrees with the allegations and inferences, including that the organisation’s purpose is to greenwash the reputation of its members … The alliance aims to accelerate innovation and channel capital into the development of effective scalable solutions to help end plastic waste and pollution.” The AEPW has had a significant lobbying presence at the UN plastic waste talks, which enter their final stages on Monday. Its representatives have consistently argued that reductions in plastic production should not be included in the treaty. The UK’s new Labour government has shifted the country’s stance and signed a ministerial declaration calling for the inclusion of reductions in production and consumption of primary plastic polymers to sustainable levels in the treaty. The United States under President Biden also shifted its position this summer to support caps on global production. It is not known yet the position of the incoming Trump administration. A UK government source said: “The government supports an effective treaty which covers the full life cycle of plastics including reducing the production and consumption of plastics to sustainable levels.” ProfSteve Fletcher, from the Revolution Plastics Institute at the University of Portsmouth, said recently there was now compelling evidence that only a reduction in primary plastic polymer production, or virgin plastic, would deliver a substantive cut in plastic pollution. Documents from the PR company Weber Shandwick outline how the AEPW was created in 2019 after they were approached by the American Chemical Council seeking ways to counter the “demonisation” of plastic and the growing calls for bans on plastic items. The alliance paid Weber Shandwick $5.6m for its work in 2019, according to US tax returns. The documents state the alliance was intended to change the conversation away from “short-term simplistic bans of plastic” and create “real, long-term solutions” for managing waste, like recycling. But documents filed in California in September, where the attorney general, Rob Bonta, is suing ExxonMobil, argue the company has deceived the public for 50 years, with misleading public statements and slick marketing, about the recyclability of plastic. The UN treaty talks start as plastic production continues to soar. Between 2000 and 2019 the global annual production of plastics doubled, reaching 460m tonnes. Plastic waste has more than doubled, from 156m tonnes in 2000 to 353m tonnes in 2019, only 9% of which was ultimately recycled, according to an OECD report. An AEPW spokesperson said: “No single organisation can solve the plastic waste challenge alone and the Alliance is cognisant of the fact that we are just one among many stakeholders who contribute with solutions … our mandate is to identify solutions that support the collection, sorting and recycling of plastic and promote a circular economy for plastics.” ExxonMobil said in a statement: “Plastics aren’t the problem – plastic waste is. We support a broad set of solutions to address plastic waste and are doing our part to contribute, including through advanced recycling, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, and by supporting the global treaty’s goal of eliminating plastic pollution by 2040. “Instead of suing us, California officials could have worked with us to fix the problem and keep plastic out of landfills … We’re bringing real solutions, recycling plastic waste that’s difficult to recycle by traditional methods … We have been direct with our customers about the plastics and products we sell. We stand by our public statements.” Shell and TotalEnergies declined to comment. ChevronPhillips and Dow did not respond to approaches for comment. The American Chemistry Council said: “In January 2019 ACC and its members launched the AEPW to help end plastic pollution. For years AEPW has operated as an independent and separately incorporated organisation. ACC has no role in AEPWs governance or decision-making.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The Western Australian government also faces a hefty bill – estimated to be $129m – to help repair an offshore nature reserve where about 900 wells have been drilled over the past six decades. Chevron says it has paid more than $1bn in royalties – about $3 a barrel – for oil and gas extracted from beneath the island, which is about 70km off the state’s north-west coast. Under state legislation written especially for the project, federal and state taxpayers will have to pay them back about nearly half that amount to help cover remediation costs. A WA government minute obtained by independent news site Boiling Cold under freedom-of-information laws suggests it will cost Chevron and its venture partners more than $2.3bn to fix the site, which has produced 335m barrels of oil. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The legislation stipulates that the company would pay 40% of the difference between Chevron’s sales revenue and operational costs, with 75% of the payment going to the federal government and 25% to WA. The legislation stated that once production ended at the site, the calculation would operate in reverse. Chevron and its partners, ExxonMobil and Santos, would be refunded 40% of what they spent on decommissioning the oilfield infrastructure for the following three years, with the federal and state governments again splitting what they paid back 75%-25%. Oil production at the site stopped in May. According to the newly released documents, the WA Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety did not have an estimate of the expected cost until Nine’s WA Today reported on the issue in 2022. That report suggested Chevron could spend $1.3bn on the clean-up in the covered timeframe, triggering a cost to the state of about $129m. Officials said they intended to “approach Chevron directly to request cost estimates”. The documents do not show what those discussions yielded. Under the terms of the deal, the commonwealth would be required to pay three times as much as the state government, implying it could face a bill of $387m. It suggests a total payment to Chevron and its partners of $516m. The final sum could be higher if Chevron spends more on the clean-up before 2028 to maximise its royalty refund. In response to questions about the expected cost, a WA department spokesperson said the refund cost was not included in the state budget forward estimates – covering the next four years – but the potential liability was recognised as “a non-quantifiable contingent liability” in an annual report on state finances. The finances report acknowledged that “a significant amount of royalties will need to be refunded” after Chevron paid the costs and the state verified and audited them. The federal Department of Industry, Science and Resources declined to comment. It is waiting on a WA government assessment of what refund is required under state law. The clean-up cost may include dealing with a gas leak near old Barrow Island oil wells that Chevron reported to the state regulator in May. The company said an unknown amount of gas was seeping to the surface near its old Barrow Island oil wells. A Chevron spokesperson said data analysis had indicated “an environmental risk from the subsurface migration of hydrocarbons, primarily gas, to groundwater and the surface”. They said the company had informed regulators and would work with them to “develop and implement a comprehensive investigation program”. The spokesperson said the company took its stewardship of Barrow Island seriously and was “committed to the responsible management of environmental impacts and risks at our sites in accordance with relevant laws and regulations”. The Greens’ Peter Whish-Wilson said Chevron needed to “come clean on the costs immediately” and the federal and state governments “shouldn’t give them an inch”. “You couldn’t imagine a more perverse deal between a big corporation and government,” he said. “This dud deal may have been struck in the 1980s but the regulatory framework underpinning the offshore fossil fuel industry is still no better today … Australia desperately needs stronger laws and regulations.” Mark Ogge, from the Australia Institute, said the case showed “the extraordinary scale of the mismanagement of Australia’s gas resources by our governments”. “This is entirely the responsibility of the Australian and WA governments. They had 40 years to fix this terrible deal but they have chosen not to. They need to be held to account,” he said. A WA government database sets out the scale of the required clean-up. About 700 of the wells on the island are more than 40 years old. Up to four drilling rigs will be used to plug the wells before they are abandoned. The procedure is designed to permanently seal the oil and gas underground, usually using cement. Remediation will be needed at 16 sites contaminated with hydrocarbons. The Gorgon liquefied natural gas plant, also operated by Chevron, will remain on the island after the wells are decommissioned.", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The US oil company is off to court in Texas to try to block a vote on a resolution tabled by Follow This, a Dutch green activist investor group that would like Exxon to move faster (a lot faster) on reducing emissions. Exxon has an argument of sorts, one might say, in that Follow This tabled similar-sounding resolutions at the last two annual meetings and neither passed. Some 27.1% of shareholders aligned with the rebels in 2022 and 10.5% last year. Why go through the same process again, the company will argue. And, since last year’s meeting at Exxon contained 13 shareholder motions in total, haven’t US regulators allowed agendas to become overcrowded? Yet the company’s legalistic stance looks absurd in at least three ways. First, Follow This is not an obscure two-bob outfit: its resolution to be heard at Shell’s annual meeting this year is being supported by 27 mainstream investment houses, including Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager. Whether Exxon likes it or not, the group represents a meaningful strand of climate opinion in the investment world. The grownup approach would surely be to make a counter-argument and let shareholders decide, just as Shell et al do. Anything else looks like a grubby attempt to avoid scrutiny. Second, the thrust of the Follow This motion merely calls on Exxon to do what most other members of the big oil club have already done and set some targets to reduce scope 3 emissions, meaning those generated by the consumption of its products. If Exxon’s board is determined to stand out by resisting such commitments, it would surely be in its own interests to seek annual validation from its owners. Third – and most obviously – Exxon could probably expect to win again. Yes, the company was humiliated in 2021 when a small hedge fund called Engine No 1 managed to get three of its own candidates voted on to the board, but rebellions (sadly) tend to succeed only when share prices are low, which is not the case at Exxon currently. Why is the company taking such a hard-headed approach? One suspects its real motive may be corporate America’s wider resentment of the growing number of shareholder resolutions being tabled these days. Exxon may see itself as striking a blow for a board’s right to manage without outside interference, especially on climate matters. That is the point at which Follow This’s struggle to be heard should concern all shareholders, whether they agree with the proposal at hand or not. Voting rights matter, and ought to be defended as a basic way to hold cocooned boards to account. The occasional real-world confrontation with the members of the awkward squad is a useful corrective. When the activist in this case could command 27% support – a minority, yes, but not a tiny one – as recently as two years ago, it ought to be seen as outrageous that Exxon thinks it can waft away dissent by running off to court. It would be a useful development if big fund managers rallied to Follow This’s defence. The right to table a climate proposal at an oil company is basic stuff.", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Elliott Management is widely expected to use its grip on the 120-year-old company to demand sweeping changes, including a potential break-up of the company, after BP lost almost a quarter of its market value in the past two years. Sources close to Elliott have reportedly warned that BP will be pushed to abandon its commitment to green energy by limiting its spending on renewables and selling off some of its low-carbon investments, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the size of the hedge fund’s stake. The aggressive New York-based fund is also expected to insist on a boardroom cull to oust BP’s leadership, including the chair, Helge Lund, alongside a reset of the company’s strategy. Elliott typically takes stakes in companies it believes have lost value because of mismanagement, and demands changes that can improve its market value. It has previously agitated for change at the drugmaker GSK and the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey. The hedge fund emerged as a threat to BP’s leadership over the weekend when it was reported that it had taken an undisclosed stake in the company. BP’s chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, was forced to use the company’s full-year results on Tuesday to defend it against the threat of a radical overhaul by promising a “fundamental reset” of its strategy. Auchincloss said BP had already “laid the foundations for growth” in 2024 by “reshaping its energy portfolio” and promised to “fundamentally reset our strategy and drive further improvements in performance” at an investor day on 26 February. “It will be a new direction for BP, and not business as usual. I am excited about it and look forward to updating the market and seeing many of you then,” he said. Under its former boss Bernard Looney, BP set a path in 2020 to become a net zero energy company by 2050, which included some of the greenest spending plans of any major oil company and won the approval of climate campaigners including Greenpeace. However, the company has backtracked from its green ambitions as surging global oil and gas market prices made fossil fuel production increasingly profitable, and handed an advantage to rivals including Shell and ExxonMobil, which plan to grow their production despite climate warnings. The company’s share price bounced by 7% on Monday after it emerged Elliott had taken the stake.

The US commerce department has announced the new tariffs, targeting companies in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, after an investigation begun a year ago when American manufacturers of solar panels accused Chinese companies of flooding the market with subsidised, cheap goods. Products from Cambodia would face the highest tariffs, of 3,521%, because its companies did not cooperate with the US investigation, while products made in Malaysia by the Chinese manufacturer Jinko Solar face duties of just over 41%; rival Trina Solar’s products from Thailand will incur tariffs of 375%. A separate US government agency, the International Trade Commission, is due to make a final decision on the tariffs in June. The case was brought last year by the Korean company Hanwha Qcells, Arizona-based First Solar and several smaller solar panel makers in the US. They accused Chinese companies with factories in Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam of shipping panels priced below their cost of production, owing to unfair state subsidies. However, critics, including the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group, have said tariffs would harm US solar producers because they would raise prices on the imported cells that are assembled into panels at American factories. Separately, the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, outlined concerns about the future of energy security ahead of a 60-country summit in London on Thursday and Friday that he is hosting with the UK energy secretary, Ed Miliband. It will be attended by ministers from the US, Japan, France, Germany and India, and oil-producing states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, along with the bosses of big oil and gas companies and renewable energy companies. Russia is excluded, and China will be absent because of a diary clash, in a blow to the summit. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sparked international sanctions, the loss of Russian gas from Europe, a spike in wholesale energy costs and a rush to secure alternative energy supplies. Birol told the Financial Times he thought the “lessons from Ukraine have not yet been fully understood”, adding that there were three golden rules for energy security: diversification of supplies, sufficient political predictability to allow companies to make long-term investments, and global cooperation. Europe remains heavily reliant on imported gas and markets have been volatile, amid changes to energy subsidies and regulations, and the trade war unleashed by Donald Trump’s frequent tariff announcements. Birol said the trade war had caused “uncertainty which will affect demand for oil and gas for some time to come”. There are growing risks surrounding energy supplies, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the climate crisis, attacks on undersea cables and cyber-attacks. “There are traditional risks and emerging risks and these have to be more in the international debate,” he said. The oil and gas producers Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, TotalEnergies, Eni and Equinor are due to attend, alongside the wind energy companies Ørsted and Vestas, and utilities EDF, Enel, Octopus and Iberdrola. “We invited China, but unfortunately they were not able to accept due to calendar reasons,” said Birol. “We wish everybody was at the table, but the countries attending the meeting make up three-quarters of the world’s GDP, which in my view is not bad at all.” The London summit will be preceded by a meeting on Wednesday between UK ministers and industry experts with technical workshops to discuss gas security, critical minerals and Ukraine’s energy system.", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

How about now? BP has been torturing itself, its shareholders and the outside world with its on-off green transition plans and its ponderous strategic “re-sets”. Not even a hard kick from the activist boot of Elliott Management has enlivened an underperforming share price. In the background, the oil price is on the slide, which is traditionally when boardroom thoughts turn to deal-making in search of easy cost-cutting wins. And here comes a report from Bloomberg over the weekend stating that Shell is studying the merits of a bid for BP, albeit with the important qualification that the would-be target’s share price might have to fall further to make the arithmetic stack up. Naturally, it would have to be a takeover, rather than a merger of equals these days, because Shell’s stock market value of £146bn towers over BP’s £56bn. In the game of fantasy deal-making, one can imagine how a pitch would go: it would be sold as a final opportunity in the oil industry’s sunset years (we hope), to build a European mega-cap firm to rival US giants ExxonMobil and Chevron. Don’t hold your breath, though. The obstacle to a deal is large and is constantly emphasised by Shell’s executives: the arithmetic of a takeover has to beat the appeal of share buy-backs, which now looks a very tall order. “I have said in the past that we want to be value hunters,” Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, said alongside last week’s first-quarter numbers. “Today, value hunting – in my view – is buying back more Shell.” He would say that, one might say – he’s not going to speculate lazily about mega-bids and empire-building. But, actually, the point is surely correct: if you’re generating oodles of cash, as Shell is, and you think your shares are dirt cheap, you need a genuinely spectacular reason not to keep buying those shares in large quantities. Shell’s share buy-backs have run at $3bn or more for 14 quarters in a row – call it $42bn, or £31.5bn, in total, or slightly more than a fifth of today’s market value in three-and-a-half years. In the share-repurchase stakes, that is going some. The exercise hasn’t done much for Shell’s share price lately – it’s down 15% in the past 12 months – but that is hardly an argument for giving up on buy-backs if you can still afford them and still believe the company is undervalued. “As the oil price has gone down, they [the shares] have actually got cheaper. So it’s an even better capital allocation for us,” said Sinead Gorman, the finance director, on the same investor call. Quite. Since the company’s charts showed buy-backs continuing even at an oil price of $50 a barrel, versus $62 today, it’s hard to see what problem a BP takeover would solve. Indeed, as UBS’s analysts pointed out, the life of Shell’s reserves would fall from 8.9 to 8.1 years. It would also be paying a premium price for the privilege of fixing BP’s over-borrowed balance sheet. On the plus side, Shell would be bigger in the Gulf of Mexico (or Gulf of America in Trump-speak) and have 23% of the world’s market for liquified gas plus an even more enormous trading operation. But, again, one comes back to off-putting buy-back maths. There’s a price for everything, of course, and Shell’s deal-making department wouldn’t be doing its job unless it was weighing up possibilities. It might also have to be alert to national politics if somebody else tried to pounce on BP: even a UK government that has given up on issuing North Sea exploration licences might have a view that Shell, rather than a US buyer, would be better. But there is no need for Shell to take the initiative: the maths, even with BP’s woes priced in, still don’t look compelling.", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil", "Shell"]}

Top US fossil fuel lobby group the American Petroleum Institute (API) sponsored a 2017 workshop for the Pennsylvania Girl Scouts, featuring “activities that mimicked work in the energy industry”. Energy giant BP in 2016 sponsored Washington DC’s National Gallery of Art and continues to fund the British Museum in London. And in 2019, Shell sponsored the Houston Open golf event for the 26th time. The new evidence of sponsorships was found in internal communications from 2015 to 2021 subpoenaed from big oil via a US congressional investigation last year. They were uncovered by Rebecca John, a researcher at the Climate Investigations Center, and published in the climate outlet DeSmog. The documents also shed light on the particular value the companies see in the partnerships. In a 2017 email, for instance, the then CEO of API said the Girl Scouts sponsorship came as part of an effort to partner with “nontraditional local allies”, which he described as “some of the best and most influential voices with targeted policymakers on industry issues” who can help the lobby group overcome “policy issues”. API has a large lobbying presence in Pennsylvania, which is the country’s second-largest gas producer. The Guardian has asked API, BP and Shell for comment. API states that it sponsors cultural endeavors because “we are a principles-based organization.” The Guardian has also sought comment from the Girl Scouts, the British Museum, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC. The British Museum has previously defended its partnership with BP, including after the company scaled back its climate goals this past February. The museum needs “corporate and private donations from companies like BP to ensure that the magnificent collection stays on display to the public for centuries to come”, a spokesperson told the Guardian at the time. The documents indicate that in Shell’s 2020 “reputation plan” it said it would “secure partnerships with credible external influencers” in an effort to overcome “low credibility and trust” in the company. The oil giant has partnered with a wide variety of major museums, sporting events, concert halls and other arts and cultural institutions. It could not be reached for comment, but its spokespeople previously said institutions can maintain their freedom even as they receive funding from Shell. A 2017 internal memo from BP America says the relationships could provide a shield from “threats to BP’s reputation”, including “overall negative sentiment about the oil and gas industry” and the “policy and politics of climate change”. A separate 2016 document assessing the company’s “position” instructed staff to emphasize the message that more than 50 million people in the UK had “engaged with a BP-supported activity” due to its funding of institutions such as the British Museum and Royal Shakespeare Company. The revelations come as activists have increasingly pressured arts and cultural institutions to cut ties with fossil fuel interests. The Royal Shakespeare Company, for instance, ended its BP partnership in 2019 after eight years, following months of protests over the partnership. At the time, BP said it was “disappointed and dismayed” by the decision. The UK’s National Portrait Gallery also ended a partnership with BP in 2022 after numerous protests against big oil’s involvement in the arts. The museum’s director said the firm’s funding “fostered creativity”. DeSmog found evidence of dozens of other cultural sponsorships from the energy companies between 2015 and 2021, including of libraries, music festivals, gender justice initiatives and theaters. There have been hundreds of similar partnerships through history, from a children’s radio show funded by Standard Oil in the 1930s, to the current sponsorship of a media podcast by BP. The relationships illustrate a decades-long industry strategy known as “affinity of purpose advertising”, said Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Brown University. The term was coined by Herbert Schmertz, the late executive of Mobil Oil (now ExxonMobil). “It’s the idea that if a corporation is associated with a high-value, cultural activity that prestige rubs off on the corporation,” said Brulle. In one well-known historical example, Mobil in the 1970s began sponsoring the television drama series Masterpiece Theater. “Apparently this works quite well,” said Brulle, noting that Mobil evaluated the approach in a 1980 study and decided it was worthwhile. “It [has] now become a commonplace activity to burnish their corporate reputation and goodwill by sponsoring these types of cultural activities.”", "section": "US news", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The summit is set to take place in November in the city of Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, which has been ravaged by deforestation linked to Brazil’s powerful agriculture industry. For the first time, the talks will be “at the epicenter of the climate crisis”, the summit’s president wrote last week. “As the Cop comes to the Amazon, forests will naturally be a central topic,” he added. But now questions are being asked about a possible conflict of interest after his team confirmed to the Guardian and CCR that it is considering bringing in the American PR giant Edelman to work on the summit. As well as its past work with some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, Edelman previously developed a “communications strategy” and message “playbook” for a trade group representing major players in the Brazilian soy industry, according to US Foreign Agent Registration Act filings. “Edelman’s conflicts of interest at a climate conference are almost too many to count,” said Duncan Meisel, the executive director of Clean Creatives, which campaigns for the PR and ad industry to cut ties with fossil fuel clients. He said the agency “maintains at least a dozen contracts with fossil fuel polluters like Shell and Chevron”. “These conflicts of interest make it impossible for Edelman to be effective advocates for Cop30’s agenda, and put the outcome of the talks in jeopardy.” Edelman defends its approach, saying it works with a range of companies and organizations to help clients reduce emissions while meeting global energy demands. Brazil is the world’s largest producer and exporter of soy. Rather than directly owning farms, most of the major companies in the country’s soy industry source from a complex network of suppliers across Brazil. Members of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oils Industry group, known as Abiove, include the biggest soy traders, such as Cargill, Bunge and Cofco. JBS, the controversial Brazilian meatpacker whose complex beef supply chain has been linked to deforestation of the Amazon, is also a member. Abiove members agreed in 2006 not to source soy from recently cleared tracts of the Amazon, a major milestone that experts credit with drastically reducing the impact of the industry on deforestation in the region. But in 2022, an investigation by the Guardian – in collaboration with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Greenpeace Unearthed, Repórter Brasil and Ecostorm – revealed that Cargill had bought soy from a farm linked to deforestation in the Amazon. And recently, Abiove has been seeking to amend the 2006 moratorium which campaigners worry will put the rainforest in jeopardy once again. Meanwhile, deforestation has continued apace elsewhere. Driven in part by the country’s booming soy industry, deforestation of the Cerrado, a vast grassland in central Brazil, has reached record levels in recent years. The campaign group Global Witness has described it as an “ecological catastrophe” for the world’s most biodiverse savannah. An agreement similar to the Amazon’s soy moratorium was first mooted for the Cerrado in 2017 by a group of 60 NGOs. Nearly two dozen major companies, including McDonald’s, Tesco and Walmart, supported its aims. In 2020, the head of Abiove said that such an agreement for the Cerrado was “unfeasible”. Between 2017 and 2023 (the most recent data available), 520,200 hectares of the Cerrado – an area larger than the Grand Canyon national park – were cleared and planted with soy, according to figures provided to the Guardian and CCR by the research group Trase. This was significantly higher than in any other biome: over the same period, there were 146,800 hectares cleared for soy planting in the Amazon, the group said. Cargill and JBS have said they are taking efforts to help curb deforestation. Edelman was hired by Abiove in 2023 to develop an “overarching communications strategy” and “message architecture playbook”, a copy of a contract filed with the US Department of Justice shows. The firm was paid $75,000 over a three-month period for work including “narrative development” and “risk analysis and scenario planning”. The firm was also scoping a potentially more lucrative second phase of its work with Abiove, which involved “coalition building” and an “ongoing communications program”. This second phase could have generated more than $50,000 per month for the agency, according to estimates included in the contract. A spokesperson for Edelman said its contract with Abiove ended in December 2023. They declined to answer questions about whether its work with Abiove involved developing messaging on deforestation and if it had informed the Cop30 team of its prior relationship with the group. Abiove did not respond to a request for comment. While press reports last month suggested Edelman had already been awarded the Cop30 contract, a spokesperson for the summit said a final decision had not yet been made. “The Brazilian Cop30 presidency is in talks with multiple consulting firms, including Edelman,” the spokesperson said. “The hiring process will involve an open bid conducted through the UNDP [United Nations Development Program].” If Edelman were to ultimately win a bid to work on Cop30 in Brazil, it would be the second time in three years it has been closely involved in efforts to deliver one of the major UN climate summits. Edelman was hired by the United Arab Emirates team hosting Cop28 in Dubai in 2023. One of Edelman’s managing directors – a former deputy press secretary for Donald Trump during his first term – was working as the summit’s president Sultan Al Jaber’s “media support”, according to an internal Cop28 document previously reported by CCR. The agency’s work with Al Jaber, who alongside his role as the UAE’s climate envoy now heads the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, dates back to the mid-2000s, DoJ filings show. Edelman’s work on Cop28 came after a period of intense scrutiny of the agency’s relationship with one of the world’s biggest oil producers, ExxonMobil, and other major fossil fuel companies. A petition circulated at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 by campaign group Clean Creatives called on Edelman to cut its ties with the industry. But during a videoconference for employees that year to address the issue, Richard Edelman was reportedly resolute: the agency would not walk away from its fossil fuel clients, he told staff, according to a New York Times report at the time. In a blogpost on the company’s website reflecting on the summit in Glasgow, Edelman praised a number of “commendable” pledges including ones to end deforestation and cut methane emissions. The summit will “serve as an important milestone in the march towards progress”, it said. According to Clean Creatives, Edelman’s work with ExxonMobil has since ended but the group claims that in recent years it has inked contracts with three more fossil fuel companies. An Edelman spokesperson said one of those three, the South African energy company Sasol, is no longer a client. Last year, the Guardian revealed that the agency had also recently worked for the Charles Koch Foundation, which is part of the libertarian network of non-profits funded by the billionaire Koch family that has pushed back against climate policies. “Edelman works with a wide range of companies, associations and organizations across every sector of the global energy industry,” a statement posted on the agency’s website states. “We are proud of the work we do to support our energy clients as they work to reduce emissions while continuing to provide reliable, affordable, and ever cleaner energy to meet the demands of a growing global population.” • This article was amended on 18 March 2025.

Delta, Gucci, Volkswagen, ExxonMobil, Disney, easyJet and Nestlé are among the major corporations to have purchased millions of carbon credits from climate friendly projects that are “likely junk” or worthless when it comes to offsetting their greenhouse gas emissions, according to a classification system developed by Corporate Accountability, a non-profit, transnational corporate watchdog. Some of these companies no longer use CO2 offsets amid mounting evidence that carbon trading do not lead to the claimed emissions cuts – and in some cases may even cause environmental and social harms. However, the multibillion-dollar voluntary carbon trading industry is still championed by many corporations including oil and gas majors, airlines, automakers, tourism, fast-food and beverage brands, fashion houses, banks and tech firms as the bedrock of climate action – a way of claiming to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint while continuing to rely on fossil fuels and unsustainable supply chains. Yet, for 33 of the top 50 corporate buyers, more than a third of their entire offsets portfolio is “likely junk” – suggesting at least some claims about carbon neutrality and emission reductions have been exaggerated according to the analysis. The fundamental failings leading to a “likely junk” ranking include whether emissions cuts would have happened anyway, as is often the case with large hydroelectric dams, or if the emissions were just shifted elsewhere, a common issue in forestry offset projects. “These findings add to the mounting evidence that peels back the greenwashed facade of the voluntary carbon market and lays bare the ways it dangerously distracts from the real, lasting action the world’s largest corporations and polluters need to be taking,” said Rachel Rose Jackson, Corporate Accountability’s director of research. The fossil fuel industry is by far the largest investor in the world’s most popular 50 CO2 offsetting schemes. At least 43% of the 81m CO2 credits purchased by the oil and gas majors are for projects that have at least one fundamental flaw and are “probably junk”, according to the analysis. The transport industry, which accounts for about a fifth of all global planet-warming emissions, has also relied heavily on carbon offsetting projects to meet climate goals. Just over 42% of the total credits (55m) purchased by airlines and 38% purchased by automakers (21m) for the top 50 projects are likely worthless at reducing emissions, the analysis found. The new analysis, shared with the Guardian, builds on a joint investigation last year into the top 50 CO2 offset projects – those that have sold the most carbon credits in the global market. The vast majority of the most popular 50 offset projects were classified as likely or potentially junk due to one or more fundamental failing that undermines its promised emission cut, according to the criteria and classification system applied to the analyses. The top 50 projects include forestry schemes, hydroelectric dams, solar and wind farms, waste disposal and greener household appliances schemes across 20 (mostly) developing countries, according to data from AlliedOffsets, the most comprehensive emissions trading database, which tracks projects from inception. They account for almost a third of the entire global voluntary carbon market (VCM), suggesting that junk or overvalued carbon credits that exaggerate emission reduction benefits could be the norm. The VCM industry works by carbon credits being tradable “allowances” or certificates that allows the purchaser to offset 1 ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent in greenhouse gasses by investing in environmental projects anywhere in the world that claim to reduce carbon emissions. Climate experts say that the carbon trading market has failed to produce the promised planetary benefits, delayed the transition away from oil, gas and coal, and caused harm to forests and communities in developing countries where most offset projects are located. On Tuesday, the Biden administration published new guidelines on responsible participation in VCMs which they say will drive credible and ambitious climate action. But critics argue that offsets are fundamentally flawed. “Overall, carbon offsets are, according to most expert analyses, neither credible nor scalable to the urgency and scale of the carbon dioxide problem,” said Richard Heede, co-director of the Climate Accountability Institute, a nonprofit research and education group. “This report documents the prevalence of ‘worthless’ or ‘likely junk’ carbon offsets in the global Voluntary Carbon Market, and undermines the corporate rationale for claiming emissions reductions based on such credits,” Heede added. The new sector-by-sector analysis found: Fossil fuel firms and airlines Oil and gas majors are among the largest corporate buyers of likely junk offsets. Almost half (49%) the 3.7m carbon credits purchased by ExxonMobil are for two projects classified as likely junk or worthless. Internal company documents show that scientists at Exxon, which is one of the world’s worst greenhouse gas emitters, were accurately predicting the impact of fossil fuels on the climate in the 1970s. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said: “Carbon offsets are a viable way to [reduce emissions and reach net zero], which is why we continue to evaluate them. We’re working to verify the claims cited in this analysis.” With the exception of fossil fuel firms, Delta has purchased more carbon credits than any other corporation. Just over 35% of the 41m carbon credits purchased by Delta were from 11 offset projects which are likely worthless or junk, according to Corporate Accountability. In California, a 2023 civil class-action alleged that Delta misrepresented itself as carbon-neutral as the company’s reliance on the carbon trading market renders its climate friendly representations as false and misleading. The judge reduced the scope of the lawsuit last month after Delta rejected the allegations and filed a motion to dismiss. The case continues. A spokesperson said the company is investing in sustainable aviation fuel, more fuel-efficient aircraft and reducing fuel use through operational efficiencies in a bid to reach “net zero” by 2050. “We have shifted away from carbon neutrality and offsets.” Meanwhile almost 72% of the 11m carbon credits ever purchased by easyJet, a popular low-cost European airline, were for projects classified as likely junk. In 2022, the airline announced plans to transition away from offsetting in favor of a “roadmap to net zero” emissions by 2050 through more fuel-efficient aircraft and perational efficiencies as well as sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture and storage – technologies which scientists have warned could exacerbate the climate crisis. An easyJet spokesperson said: “In the short period we did offset customer emissions, we had robust due diligence processes in place, with all projects recommended by expert partners and all required to meet the highest standards available.” A 2021 joint investigation by the Guardian revealed that major airlines including Delta and easyJet were using unreliable “phantom” carbon credits to claim their flights were carbon neutral. Car makers, entertainment giants, luxury goods Almost half (46%) of the 11m CO2 credits purchased by Volkswagen from the top 50 projects were likely junk, according to the analysis. The German carmaker recently announced a joint venture to develop its own carbon credit projects and said they increasingly rely on on-site inspections, due diligence and audit processes to verify projects. VW aims to reduce its emissions by 90% compared to 2018 by converting its energy supply and increasing energy efficiency among other measures. In the world of entertainment, almost 62% of the 5.8m carbon credits retired by Disney are from two offset projects which have been classified as likely junk or worthless. The analysis also found that 75% of the 4.4m carbon credits purchased by the Italian luxury fashion house Gucci have been for projects classified as likely junk. Gucci, which was once a high-profile proponent of offsetting, last year dropped its carbon neutral claim amid growing evidence that the rainforest projects it relied on were likely junk and potentially harmful. Gucci is finalizing new climate commitments with a greater focus on cutting absolute emissions through its supply chain. The food and drinks industry is a major climate polluter – and investor in carbon markets, with 37% of the industry-wide credits purchased from projects classified as likely junk. Food and drinks industry The analysis found that almost 36% of the 2.2m carbon credits purchased by Nestlé, the world’s largest food and beverage company, were from five offset projects which have been classified as likely junk. Nestlé said that it stopped purchasing credits from these projects in 2021/2022. “Reaching net zero emissions at Nestlé does not involve using offsetting: we focus on GHG emissions reductions and removals within our value chain to reach our net zero ambition.” While some corporations have signaled a shift away from carbon offsetting, the VCM is still valued between $2 and $3bn – despite warnings that the industry is a false solution delaying the world’s transition away from oil, gas and coal. “This research once again shows that big corporate polluters claiming climate credentials are the main buyers of junk credits. But racking up carbon credits doesn’t make you a climate leader. Cutting fossil fuels does. We can’t offset our way to a safe climate future,” said Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law (Ciel). “For all the talk about carbon credits accelerating climate action, they are actually greenwashing climate destruction.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

About a quarter of shareholders voted against the chair, Helge Lund, at the company’s annual meeting in Sunbury-on-Thames, on the edges of London, which attracted protest from several green campaign groups. The Guardian understands that five protesters were forcibly blocked from entering the meeting before the vote, which marked the first time in at least a decade that more than 10% of BP’s shareholders voted against the re-election of the chair. The activists from Fossil Free London and Energy Embargo for Palestine protested outside the venue, describing the board as “murderers, looters and genocide enablers”, before major institutional investors voted against the re-election of Lund. The shareholder meeting was held weeks after Lund, who presided over BP’s failed green agenda, promised to step down from the company by next year. Despite his resignation, the chair was forced to face a shareholder vote to re-elect him to the post until his departure, creating a lightning rod for disgruntled investors. The resolution received a provisional 24.3% of opposed votes. The outgoing chair told shareholders that the company had “pursued too much while looking to build new low-carbon businesses” but that “lessons have been learned”. BP’s chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, repeated his previous claim that BP’s optimism in the global green energy transition was “misplaced”, and that the board’s “one simple goal” was to “grow the long-term value of your investment”. A strategy overhaul was considered by many industry commentators as BP’s only defence against the advance of an aggressive activist investor fund that could threaten the breakup of the 115-year-old company. The feared New York fund Elliott Investment Management amassed a stake in the company earlier this year. It typically takes aim at underperforming companies by agitating for changes that could resuscitate their flagging market value. Elliott is expected to call for sweeping changes to BP, which has lagged behind rivals such as Shell and ExxonMobil that have profited from the global energy market crisis in recent years by increasing their fossil fuel production. Mark Van Baal, the founder of the green activist investor group Follow This, said shareholders had “made it clear that weakening climate commitments is unacceptable”. He added: “This historical result serves as a wake-up call to BP’s board and emphasises investor expectation for robust governance mechanisms and genuine leadership on ESG issues.” Agathe Masson, a campaigner at Reclaim Finance, said the historic vote “sends a clear message to the BP board that their green U-turn was a backwards step and that some shareholders clearly want to invest in a green transition”. The rebellion included the UK asset manager Legal &amp; General, a leading shareholder in BP, which voiced plans to vote against Lund’s re-election ahead of the vote, citing the company’s recent green U-turn and its decision not to allow its shareholders to vote on the new direction. Under Auchincloss, BP has scrapped plans to restrict its fossil fuel production in favour of green investments. Instead, the company will be “very selective” about investing in low-carbon options while growing its planned fossil fuel production to 2.4m barrels of oil and gas a day by 2030 – about 60% higher than the figure in its net zero plan set out five years ago. The vote marks the biggest rebellion against the board since 2016, when almost 60% of shareholders voted against BP’s decision to hand the then CEO, Bob Dudley, a $20m (£15.1m) pay packet in the same year that a global oil market rout pushed the company to record losses. The latest shareholder standoff took place almost 15 years to the day after the deadly Deepwater Horizon disaster led to the largest marine oil spill in US history and plunged the company into a $70bn dollar crisis. The company announced this week an oil discovery in “the Gulf of America” – using Donald Trump’s newly mandated US name for the Gulf of Mexico – which it said underscored its plan to “step up investment in exploration”.", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The warning, from the head of an industry-created group known as the Air Pollution Foundation, was revealed by Climate Investigations Center and published Tuesday by the climate website DeSmog. It represents what may be the earliest instance of big oil being informed of the potentially dire consequences of its products. “Every time there’s a push for climate action, [we see] fossil fuel companies downplay and deny the harms of burning fossil fuels,” said Rebecca John, a researcher at the Climate Investigations Center who uncovered the historic memos. “Now we have evidence they were doing this way back in the 50s during these really early attempts to crack down on sources of pollution.” The Air Pollution Foundation was founded in 1953 by oil interests in response to public outcry over smog that was blanketing Los Angeles county. Researchers had identified hydrocarbon pollution from fossil fuel sources such as cars and refineries as a primary culprit and Los Angeles officials had begun to proposal pollution controls. The Air Pollution Foundation, which was primarily funded by the lobbying organization Western States Petroleum Association, publicly claimed to want to help solve the smog crisis, but was set up in large part to counter efforts at regulation, the new memos indicate. It’s a commonly used tactic today, said Geoffrey Supran, an expert in climate disinformation at the University of Miami. “The Air Pollution Foundation appears to be one of the earliest and most brazen efforts by the oil industry to prop up a … front group to exaggerate scientific uncertainty to defend business as usual,” Supran said. “It helped lay the strategic and organizational groundwork for big oil’s decades of climate denial and delay.” Then called the Western Oil and Gas Association, the lobbying group provided $1.3m to the group in the 1950s – the equivalent of $14m today – to the Air Pollution Foundation. That funding came from member companies including Shell and firms later bought by or merged with ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Sunoco and ConocoPhillips, as well as southern California utility SoCalGas. The Air Pollution Foundation recruited the respected chemical engineer Lauren B Hitchcock to serve as its president. And in 1954, the organization – which until then was arguing that households incinerating waste in backyards was to blame – asked Caltech to submit a proposal to determine the main source of smog. In November 1954, Caltech submitted its proposal, which included crucial warnings about the coal, oil, and gas and said that “a changing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere with reference to climate” may “ultimately prove of considerable significance to civilization”, a memo previously uncovered by John shows. The newly uncovered documents show the Air Pollution Foundation shared the warning with the Western Oil and Gas Association’s members in March 1955. In the mid-1950s, climate researchers were beginning to understand the planet-heating impact of fossil fuels, and to discuss their emergent research in the media. But the newly uncovered Air Pollution Foundation memo represents the earliest known cautionary message to the oil industry about the greenhouse effect. The Air Pollution Foundation’s board of trustees, including representatives from SoCalGas and Union Oil, which was later acquired by Chevron, approved funding for the Caltech project. In the following months, foundation president Hitchcock advocated for pollution controls on oil refineries and then testified in favor of state-funded pollution research in the California Senate. Hitchcock was reprimanded by industry leaders for these efforts. In an April 1955 meeting, the Western Oil and Gas Association told him he was drawing too much “attention” to refinery pollution and conducting “too broad a program” of research. The Air Pollution Foundation was meant to be “protective” of the industry and should publish “findings which would be accepted as unbiased”, meeting minutes uncovered by John show. After this meeting, the foundation made no further reference to the potential climate impact of fossil fuels, publications reviewed by DeSmog suggest. “The fossil fuel industry is often seen as having followed in the footsteps of the tobacco industry’s playbook for denying science and blocking regulation,” said Supran. “But these documents suggest that big oil has been running public affairs campaigns to downplay the dangers of its products just as long as big tobacco, starting with air pollution in the early-to-mid-1950s.” In the following months, many of the foundation’s research projects were scaled back or designed to be conducted in direct partnerships with lobbying groups. Hitchcock resigned as president in 1956. Last year, the largest county in Oregon sued the Western States Petroleum Association for allegedly sowing doubt about the climate crisis despite longstanding knowledge of it. DeSmog and the Climate Investigations Center previously found that the Air Pollution Foundation underwrote the earliest studies on CO2 conducted in 1955 and 1956 by renowned climate scientist Charles David Keeling, paving the way for his groundbreaking “Keeling Curve,” which charts how fossil fuels cause an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Other earlier investigations have found that major fossil companies spent decades conducting their own research into the consequences of burning coal, oil and gas. One 2023 study found that Exxon scientists made “breathtakingly” accurate predictions of global heating in the 1970s and 1980s, only to then spend decades sowing doubt about climate science. The newly unearthed documents come from the Caltech archives, the US National Archives, the University of California at San Diego, the State University of New York Buffalo archives and Los Angeles newspapers from the 1950s. The Western States Petroleum Association and the American Petroleum Institute, the top US fossil fuels lobby group, did not respond to requests for comment.", "section": "US news", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Now the price of crude has collapsed", "date": null, "author": "Jillian Ambrose", "publication": "The Observer", "text": "After Donald Trump’s “liberation day” on Wednesday last week, BP lost almost a quarter of its market value in a share price rout even deeper than the oil giant endured in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The collapse in global oil prices in the wake of the US president’s tariff blitz may have wiped billions from its market value – but Trump isn’t BP’s only problem. The oil company will face shareholders this week for the first time since it bowed to investor pressure to abandon its green energy ambitions in favour of a return to fossil fuels, and its chair, Helge Lund, agreed to step down from the board. The twin retreats were considered the only defence against the advance of an aggressive activist investor fund that could spell the breakup of the 115-year-old company, which has been haemorrhaging value for years. Elliott Asset Management, a feared New York hedge fund notorious for shaking up laggard companies, amassed a substantial stake in BP earlier this year. It has reportedly been in talks with key investors over the future of BP after its ill-fated plan to become a green energy company. The resignation of Lund will not spare the board the embarrassment of a bloody nose from shareholders, many of whom are likely to protest by voting against the chair’s reappointment even though he has already decided to leave. The board may also take some relief in knowing that its greatest climate activist foe, the shareholder campaign group Follow This, has decided not to put forward a resolution calling for greater emissions cuts at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting amid growing investor antagonism over ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues. BP set out the plan to reduce its fossil fuel production under former chief executive Bernard Looney in late 2020, the year before its industry rivals began raking in bumper profits from rocking global oil and gas markets. At the same time, BP’s plan to invest in low-carbon energy projects, including two giant offshore windfarms in UK waters, were dealt a blow by the soaring cost of borrowing and post-pandemic supply chain bottlenecks that pushed costs higher across the industry. After Looney’s humiliating exit from the company in late 2023, his successor, former finance chief Murray Auchincloss, began to water down the green plans. He set out a “fundamental reset” of BP’s strategy, blaming the company’s “misplaced” optimism in the green transition. But BP’s pivot back to fossil fuels may already be floundering. The oil company told investors on Friday that its first-quarter results for the year would include lower than expected gas production figures and a “weak” trading result. Worryingly, the company revealed that net debt surged by $4bn (£3bn) in the first three months of the year, as fears over the global financial uncertainty reached fever pitch. BP is considered more exposed to the fallout of Trump’s tariffs, which caused market prices for oil to plummet from almost $75 a barrel to under $60 for the first time in almost four years, due to fears that a trade war will tip the global economy into recession and shrink the world’s appetite for crude. Already, the company appears to have been harder hit by the sell-off than its rivals in the US and Europe. Since the start of the year its share price has plummeted by almost 17%, while Shell has lost just over 8% and US rivals ExxonMobil and Chevron have lost about 7% each. Equity analysts at investment bank UBS downgraded their view of the company from “buy” to “neutral” after warning that the fall in oil and gas prices could slash BP’s earnings over the coming years by as much as a fifth. BP’s strategic reset “was an important first step to restore investor confidence, in our view”, said UBS equity analyst Joshua Stone. “The next steps, including a reduction of net debt and replenishment of the reserves base, were always going to take longer to achieve, but the level of financial uncertainty in the market makes delivery harder in our view, especially as it relates to BP’s ability to grow earnings and sell assets.”", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

In a major strategy shift, the energy company will increase its investment in oil and gas to $10bn (£7.9bn) a year while slashing more than $5bn from its previous green investment plan. The radical overhaul means BP will be “very selective” about investing in low-carbon options while producing 2.4m barrels of oil and gas a day by 2030 – about 60% higher than the figure in its net zero plan set out five years ago. “Today we have fundamentally reset BP’s strategy,” said BP’s CEO, Murray Auchincloss. “This is a reset BP, with an unwavering focus on growing long-term shareholder value.” The move back towards fossil fuels represents a stark shift from the investment plan put forward five years ago by the former chief executive, Bernard Looney. He had promised to shrink the company’s fossil fuel production to about 1.5m barrels a day and make BP a net zero energy company by 2050. Auchincloss said BP would instead focus on strengthening its production portfolio by starting up 10 large-scale oil and gas projects by 2027 and a further eight to 10 projects by the end of the decade. He said: “Our optimism for a fast [energy] transition was misplaced, and we went too far, too fast.” There has been growing pressure from investors for BP to shrug off its green pledges, which initially won praise from green groups but have since been diluted as BP’s share price fell. BP has lost almost a quarter of its market value in the past two years while the market value of its rivals Shell and ExxonMobil has increased as they pursued greater oil and gas production. The company also faces an existential threat from the activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which in recent months has amassed a stake in the oil company worth almost £3.8bn, or 5% of its shares. The New York hedge fund is widely expected to use its grip on the 120-year-old company to demand sweeping changes, including a potential breakup, to rescue its flagging market value. The dismantling of Looney’s green agenda will come alongside a plan to cut BP’s growing debt pile from almost $23bn at the end of last year to between $14bn and $18bn by the end of 2027. The company plans to sell $20bn of assets, possibly including its Castrol lubricants business, its network of service stations and the solar power developer Lightsource BP, while trimming up to $3bn from its overall investments and cutting up to $5bn in costs from across the company by the end of 2027. Matilda Borgström, a campaigner at the climate action group 350.org, said: “This move by oil giant BP clearly demonstrates why super-rich corporations and individuals, chasing short-term profit for themselves and shareholders, cannot be trusted with fixing the climate crisis or leading the transition to renewable energy we so badly need. “Pumping money into more oil and gas increases the risk of climate impacts for us all, flies in the face of legal climate targets and, with the renewables sector growing exponentially, is a big risk to the shareholders that BP is so keen to please.”", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

However, investors should perhaps note that the International Energy Agency (IEA) is forecasting that peak oil is at hand. In other words, supply will soon outstrip demand, making investment in new oilfields unlikely to be profitable. The IEA’s predictions are based on the take-up of electric vehicles, particularly in China. The main impetus behind the increasing market for oil over the past 15 years has been the demand for cars from the increasingly affluent Chinese public. But now the majority of Chinese electric cars are cheaper than those powered by petrol or diesel. This, coupled with the switch of heavy goods vehicles to liquified natural gas (LNG) and the country’s high-speed rail network (using hydrogen, electricity and coal) means Chinese demand for oil will drop, according to the agency. This switch is taking place everywhere, though at a lower speed, the IEA says. Last year 20% of cars sold globally were electric, a figure expected to rise to close to 50% by 2030, and continuing to grow thereafter. Oil demand will therefore peak by the end of this decade and start to fall. New oilfields, especially with high development costs, may soon become stranded assets.

The oil company told staff on Tuesday that it would cut 4,700 jobs and scrap another 3,000 contractor positions, after its chief executive promised to reduce the company’s costs by at least $2bn (£1.6bn) by the end of 2026. Murray Auchincloss has come under pressure from shareholders to improve BP’s returns amid growing dissatisfaction over the strategy set by his predecessor, Bernard Looney, before he was ousted from the top job for failing to disclose personal relationships with colleagues. In an internal memo to staff, first reported by Reuters, Auchincloss said he understood and recognised the “uncertainty this brings for everyone whose job may be at risk” and also “the effect it can have on colleagues and teams”. He said: “We began a multiyear programme to simplify and focus BP last year – strengthening our competitiveness and building in resilience as we lower our costs, drive performance improvement and play to our distinctive capabilities. “We have got more we need to do through this year, next year and beyond, but we are making strong progress as we position BP to grow as a simpler, more focused, higher-value company.” BP employs 87,800 people worldwide. As of 2022, it had 15,000 in the UK where its head office is in London, with other offices in the south-east of England and in Aberdeen. Auchincloss, who was previously BP’s finance chief, was expected to use an investor event in New York early next month to reassure shareholders of the company’s strategy after a string of disappointing financial results and a sluggish share performance. However, earlier this week the company postponed the event to 26 February and changed the location from New York to London so that Auchincloss can recuperate from a “planned medical procedure”. He is expected to be back in the office by February, BP said. At the same time, BP revealed a worrying trading update for the final quarter of last year before its full-year results next month. The update warned that oil production for the last quarter would be lower than in the previous quarter, while the profit margins from its refining business would be “weaker” and its oil trading performance would be “weak”. BP has fallen out of favour with investors since Looney set out a plan to slash its oil and gas production in favour of spending billions on green energy projects. Under Auchincloss, the company has begun to dilute its climate pledges, but investors remain concerned over the returns BP can expect from its big-ticket green projects, including multibillion-pound plans to develop offshore windfarms off the UK coast. BP’s shares have fallen by about 7% in the past year, while its rivals Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil – which are pursuing higher oil and gas production – have seen their market values climb by 8% or more.

The Reform UK leader was the guest of honour at the launch of Heartland UK/Europe, which is to be headed by a former leader of Ukip and climate denier. The former prime minister Liz Truss was seen at the event in London, alongside current Tory MPs Andrew Griffith, who is the shadow trade minister, and Christopher Chope. The establishment of this UK branch of the Heartland Institute – which has links to the incoming Trump administration and has drawn on funding from companies including ExxonMobil and wealthy US Republican donors – comes as Farage seeks to make hostility to net zero a centrepiece of Reform’s electoral pitch. Reform MPs have used speaking time in parliament to push for the scrapping of net zero targets and to call for new coalmines. Heartland has made some extreme and incorrect comments on climate. In the past, it has compared people who believe in global heating to the Unabomber, the US terrorist jailed for killing three people and injuring many others. It has also wrongly claimed heatwaves are not increasing in the US because of the climate crisis. The Heartland Institute president, James Taylor, said: “During recent years, a growing number of policymakers in the UK and continental Europe have requested Heartland establish a satellite office to provide resources to conservative policymakers throughout Europe. With our UK and European launch, we aim to fulfil this requested impact throughout Europe.” Lois Perry, who led Ukip until June and has described the climate emergency as “a scam”, will head the UK branch. She has made regular appearances on GB News, where she has played down the existence of, and threats posed by, the climate crisis. The launch in December was held in the exclusive Brooks’s private members club in Mayfair, one of the few remaining gentlemen’s clubs that does not admit women. Farage has struck up a close relationship with the group. In an interview in October with Taylor, he claimed the “minority position” against net zero was “gaining ground”. A leading UK-based climate research institute said Heartland had a track record of promoting extreme versions of climate science denial in the US. Bob Ward, the director of communications at the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: “Heartland no doubt feels emboldened by the prospect of a new Trump administration that is promising to carry out an ideological purge of anything related to climate action.”. The development was described by the Green party co-leader Adrian Ramsay as a move to “import dirty US climate-denying money into British politics”. “That Farage seems so willing to sell out British interests and front climate denial for his own short-term gain should alarm us all,” he added. Griffith said: “In any year, I attend hundreds of external events with business organisations and thinktanks, none of which automatically imply my endorsement.

The five “super-majors” – BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies – showered shareholders with dividend payments and share buybacks worth $104bn in the 2022 calendar year, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). The bumper payouts followed a year of record profits for big oil and gas companies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended global energy markets, triggering a rise in the international price of Brent crude and record gas prices across Europe. Financial analysts at IEEFA said the companies were likely to pay even greater shareholder distributions this year despite weaker commodity market prices leading to lower profits. The payouts will also follow a year that is expected to have been hotter than any other on record, with the climate emergency leading to a series of extreme weather events. Trey Cowan, an analyst at the IEEFA, said: “At the current pace of distributions via share buybacks and dividends, these five super-majors could set a record for distributions to shareholders in 2023, topping the $104bn spent during the 2022 calendar year.” Shell angered climate campaigners in November by setting out plans to pay shareholders at least $23bn in rewards this year, despite falling profits. The sum is more than six times the amount Shell planned to spend on renewable energy last year. Shell’s investor windfall follows one of the biggest annual profits in UK corporate history for 2022 when the oil company revealed profits of $40bn but weaker commodity market prices in 2023 mean its full-year earnings are expected to be lower. BP used its second-quarter results last year to tell shareholders to expect a 10% dividend raise in 2023, well above its initial guidance. The company had promised to raise the dividend by 4% each year and buy back about $4bn of shares, assuming the oil price was about $60 a barrel, but over the previous four quarters BP had repurchased $10bn of shares and increased its dividend by 20%. The handouts were particularly surprising after the company reported a deeper-than-expected profit slump. They were welcomed by investors, amid concern among some about the plans of the former chief executive Bernard Looney to “reimagine” BP as a net zero energy company by 2050. Oil companies continue to offer generous shareholder handouts as investors face growing pressure to divest their shares. Protests targeting oil company AGMs and conferences have become increasingly disruptive in recent years as campaigners demand more ambitious climate action. They have also faced hostility from campaign groups that have accused the companies of profiting from Russia’s war while millions of households have been plunged into a cost of living crisis driven by high energy costs. Alice Harrison, a campaigner at Global Witness, said: “The global energy crisis has been a giant cash grab for fossil fuel firms. And instead of investing their record profits in clean energy, these companies are doubling down on oil, gas and shareholder payouts. “Yet again millions of families won’t be able to afford to heat their homes this winter, and countries around the world will continue to suffer the extreme weather events of climate collapse. This is the fossil fuel economy, and it’s rigged in favour of the rich.” Some green groups believe lucrative shareholder rewards are being used to distract investors from the public backlash against the oil industry, and a terminal shift in government policies away from fossil fuels. But Dieter Helm, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford and a former government adviser, believes the payouts suggest the industry remains confident about its future profitability. Helm used his 2017 book Burnout: the Endgame for Fossil Fuels to set out how the oil industry might respond to the existential threat of climate action. In a “harvest and exit” strategy companies would probably wring out as much value for their shareholders as possible, while winding down their future fossil fuel spending, he suggested. But the climate agenda is unlikely to be playing a role in recent record shareholder paydays, he said. “For this to be the case you would have to believe that the energy transition is happening, and that demand for fossil fuels is going to fall. These companies are investing a huge amount in new projects, and they’re handing out bigger dividends because they are confident that they’re going to make big returns. And when we look at the state of our current climate progress, who’s to say they’re wrong?” The oil industry’s record investor payouts have been largely buoyed by a sharp increase in share buybacks, according to analysts at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence (SPMI), which plays some role in future-proofing oil company payouts. Share buybacks allow companies to share a surge in profits with investors without the long-term commitment of a change to the dividend policy. They also help to reduce the number of shares in the market, which would make future dividend policies “cheaper” to fulfil. “In the US, Chevron leads a $75bn repurchase programme, followed by ExxonMobil’s $50bn. In Europe, Eni and Equinor have massively increased buybacks, up to 20% of cashflows from operations, albeit dividends remained as their priority. We forecast Shell and BP to allocate 15-18% of cashflow to dividends and about 25% to buybacks in 2024,” SPMI said. The analysts expect the oil and gas industry to relinquish its position as the sector that pays the biggest dividends in 2024, dropping to second place behind banks. The IEEFA’s Cowan says: “The [oil industry] is beginning to empty its war chest used to pay shareholders faster than they can replenish it. Future distributions to shareholders of these companies appear likely to fall and not continue to ascend.”", "section": "Business", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

Like much of the city, her neighbourhood, Wortmanville, is about two metres below sea level and protected by the Kingston Seawall, a 280-mile barrier built in 1860 to keep the sea at bay . Georgetown is one of the world’s most vulnerable capitals when it comes to extreme flooding and rising sea levels. In 2005, the city was hit by floods that affected 290,000 people, a reminder of Guyana’s Indigenous meaning – “land of many waters”. Even so, Parasnath pins her meagre hopes for a better life on Guyana’s new promise: oil and gas – the same fossil fuels igniting the climate crisis. Like many, she hopes to receive a $5,000 government cash grant, an urban plot to build her own house in a safer place and a scholarship to go to university. “They keep saying they will give us money from the oil, right?” Parasnath says, with just a hint of scepticism. Since 2015, when US multinational ExxonMobil found oil in Guyana – then one of the poorest countries in the Americas – its 800,000 citizens have been swiftly climbing the ranks of nations with the highest GDP per capita, thanks to one of the world fastest-growing economies. In 2023, the GDP of this “South American Qatar” rose by 33%, and is expected to grow by another 34% in 2024. Oil royalties and exports contributed approximately $1.62bn (£1.27bn) to the government’s annual revenue last year, with projections to increase to $2.42bn by 2024 and $7.5bn by 2040 – enough to dramatically boost the national budget, estimated at $5.49bn in 2024. In the decade since ExxonMobil discovered the Liza oilfield, 190km (118 miles) off the coast of Guyana, the country has risen as a new world oil magnate. This former British colony has about 90% of the area of the UK but only 1.2% of its population. Its oil reserves are estimated at 11bn oil-equivalent barrels, which is 75% of the oil reserves of its giant neighbour Brazil. The International Energy Agency estimates the offshore discoveries could mean Guyana’s 2022 production of 250,000 barrels daily will grow fivefold by 2030. That makes Guyana a protagonist in the Latin America and the Caribbean oil rush. While Guyana is located in South America, it is considered a Caribbean country and shares cultural ties with its Latin American neighbours. Amid the global debate on transitioning away from fossil fuels, half the countries in the region – 16 out of the 33 – are involved in new, major oil and gas extraction projects. *** Guyana is betting on oil, as the global production and consumption steadily increases. Faced with a bullish world oil market, many in the global southask why Guyana, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina or Mexico should be expected not to exploit such highly valued commodities. Ashni Singh, Guyana’s finance minister, argues the country is within its moral rights to capitalise on its resources. Guyana devised its first Low Carbon Development Strategy “long before the discovery of oil”, he argues, making the country “a unique player in oil exploitation and environmental protection”. Under the strategy, Guyana sought income to maintain its forests, leading to a $250m, five-year agreement with Norway. This funding supported a monitoring, recording and verification (MRV) system for transitioning to a low-carbon economy and participating in the carbon market. The country then became the first to certify its carbon credits, “combining its forest conservation efforts with global carbon trading mechanisms,” says Singh. “The journey that led to ExxonMobil coming to Guyana, starting exploration, and eventually discovering oil has been a sustained effort to diversifying the pre-oil economy,” says Singh. “Our low-carbon strategy is not a response to Guyana becoming an oil producer.” Oil royalties, he says, will not erase the low-carbon policy but facilitate a sustainable development strategy. “Oil allowed us to move more quickly towards that destination where every Guyanese can live comfortably, get a good-quality job and educate their children with access to good-quality social services,” he says. “We want Guyana to become the first really developed nation in South America.” According to the UN resident coordinator in Georgetown, Yesim Oruc, Guyana’s situation is indeed unique: a developing country with low deforestation rates – 97% of the country’s Amazon rainforest is intact – finding an opportunity for oil and gas-based development. Oruc praises the government’s ambition in energy transition, which foresees oil and gas royalties invested in hydroelectric power and renewable sources. “As a small developing country, the amount of greenhouse gas Guyana emits is nonexistent,” says Oruc. “And even with all the oil production, according to the government’s calculations, the country will still remain carbon-negative. “The oil that Guyana produces creates emissions elsewhere in the world. Guyana’s contribution to CO2 emissions, which is the global issue, is virtually nil. The point is, will the world economy refrain from consuming oil or not?” *** Oil and gas exploration has wide support. In economic, political and civil society circles, it is hard to find anyone who disagrees. Kester Hutson, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is enthusiastic about Guyana’s fast-paced economic development. “What we are living right now, with the introduction of the oil and gas sector into the economy, is something we would have never imagined,” he says, ensuring the environment remains a priority. “There’s no immediate need to worry.” Even critics of President Mohamed Irfaan Ali recognise the gains that fossil fuels can bring. Aubrey Norton, the leader of the opposition, criticises the royalties and terms of the contract signed with ExxonMobil and the policy of distributing the benefits of oil, but does not question the exploitation. “Oil allows us the resources to develop the country. The downside is that you have a government that isn’t focused on the development of the people of Guyana,” says Norton. For Jean La Rose, a Goldman prize winner for her fight for the rights of Indigenous peoples – known as Amerindians – exploiting fossil fuels is a “very difficult question”. “Guyana has encountered a lot of economic difficulties.” she says. “Our Indigenous communities need a lot of infrastructure and other forms of development to improve health care and education. So, the exploitation of our natural resources can help in some ways. “But exploiting natural resources, [previously] in the form of mining for gold, diamonds and other minerals, even if it had benefited some Indigenous communities, also had negative implications for land and environmental rights, pollution and social problems.” Many Guyanese are critical however of how successive governments have handled the oil boom and shared the proceeds. President Ali’s administration is often described as discriminatory against the black and Amerindian populations in favour of the Indo-Guyanese. The contract with ExxonMobil is also a sensitive topic. “The relationship between the oil companies and the government of Guyana is one of disrespect for the people of this nation,” says Frederick Collins, president of the Transparency Institute Guyana. “The government takes the side of the oil company against the people, as has been seen in legal challenges to the way the Environmental Protection Agency is operating.” Another recurring accusation is that the government disregards legality in infrastructure development projects. Elizabeth Deane-Hughes, a former lawyer, fought against land expropriations for a gas pipeline project that would pass through her family’s lands. After legal action, the pipeline was modified, but the clashes with the government left the impression that the state would go above the law to implement its project. “It’s all about the rule of law,” she says. The Guardian repeatedly contacted President Ali, Vice-President Bharrat Jagdeo, and Prime Minister Mark Phillips to comment on the allegations, but none responded. Alistair Routledge, the president and general manager at ExxonMobil Guyana, also did not respond to interview requests. *** Despite the complaints, the pace of Guyana’s growth is noticeable out onit’s streets. Although Georgetown still faces serious infrastructure gaps, trucks carrying construction supplies and workers labouring on new highways, hotels, shopping malls and luxury homes in gated neighbourhoods are everywhere. New hospitals and schools are under development inside and outside the capital as part of the president’s public service promises. Georgetown’s mayor, Alfred Mentore, says: “Our capital’s GDP per capita grew 63% in 2022 and about 40% in 2023. The capital works and infrastructure growth is at a rapid pace.” But not everything is resolved, says Mentore. “We need to make sure that not only those causing this growth gain but also those at the bottom level also benefit from this kind of trickle-down effect.” And the debate around who benefits from the new oil rush money is a hot topic. A frequent question is whether Guyana can become a prosperous and egalitarian country – or whether it will be another state producing fossil fuels for the benefit of a few. Coretta McDonald, a teacher and trade unionist, was elected as an opposition MP under the banner of distributing the new wealth. “I see a lot of optimism from government officials and scepticism from ordinary people,” she says. “Real people in the streets are not seeing, at least for now, the concrete benefits from the oil.” In a country where the cost of food has soared – a meal at a fast-food chain can cost £25 – many feel they are paying the environmental price of oil and gas exploration but not profiting from the economic boom. Mark Murray, a 38-year-old construction worker, is considering emigrating: “You can’t feed your family as you like. The average person cannot eat earning $20 a day in Guyana.” • This article was amended on 10 July 2024.

By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing 278,000 barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative. Today, with a population of 1.5 million and oil production down to less than 54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’s only petroleum refinery closed in 2018 due to mismanagement and declining production by the state-owned Petrotrin company. A recent analysis noted that the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn. With crude oil production declining since the 2000s (while gas increased, then sharply decreased), the country faces a standoff. Environmentalists are calling for a greener economy, while the new government, like its predecessors, pushes for more deepwater exploration. “We have fallen victim to ‘Dutch disease’ – a dependence on one single sector – which has defined who we are from an economic and social perspective,” says Indera Sagewan, an economist and director of the Caribbean Centre for Competitiveness. “Non-energy economic diversification is imperative as the way forward for Trinidad and Tobago. We are living a defining moment.” Unlike other oil-dependent states, such as Norway, the UAE and Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago has failed to maximise the benefits of the Heritage and Stabilisation Fund, which was established in 2007 to invest surplus revenues as a means of consolidating the legacy of oil wealth. Now, the country faces the prospect of chronic low growth, according to an OECD report published in December. Last year, GDP grew by an estimated 1.7%, up from 1.4% in 2023. The government also faces rising unemployment rates and fiscal pressures, with public debt reaching 64.5% of GDP in 2024 – higher than the average of 51.9% in Central America and the Caribbean, according to the OECD. To escape the low-growth trap, experts such as Sagewan have long argued that Trinidad and Tobago should diversify its economy, a challenge for a commodity-exporting country reliant on oil and gas. Introduced in 2022, the country’s green hydrogen strategy is a step in that direction, aiming to overhaul the energy sector by shifting from grey to green hydrogen (the former produced from gas, which creates CO2 emissions; the latter splitting water using renewable energy), using existing petrochemical infrastructure, and producing 4m tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2065. The country has also announced plans to install 57GW of offshore wind capacity by 2065 with the aim of achieving 30% renewable electricity generation. Yet, all of that remains just a “very early-stage” plans, according to Sagewan. On 13 August, the government of the prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, signalled its intent to press on with fossil fuels by signing a deal with ExxonMobil to explore a vast ultra-deepwater block off the country’s east coast, covering more than 7,000 sq km in waters more than 1.2 miles (2km) deep. If reserves are found, the investment could reach up to $21.7bn, according to the energy minister, Roodal Moonilal. The deal underscores the new government’s commitment to deepwater drilling, seeking new discoveries in unexplored Atlantic waters like the oil rush in nearby Guyana and Suriname. “There is no real strong stakeholder movement here that says: ‘Stop exploring for oil and gas in Trinidad and Tobago’,” says Dax Driver, chief executive of the Energy Chamber, the industry’s lobby group. *** From the first oil well drilled in the 19th century to the discovery of offshore gas fields in the 1990s, fossil fuels have been Trinidad and Tobago’s economic lifeblood, bringing infrastructure and wealth far beyond Caribbean neighbours. The oil money transformed lives for the better in many ways: free university education, extensive public-sector employment, subsidised electricity, gas and water that were among the cheapest utilities in the world, and petrol prices at a third of UK levels. A thriving middle class and a wealthy elite emerged; highways, hospitals and airports were built. But wealth also fuelled corruption, inequality and violent crime. The country remains heavily dependent on oil, while drilling and spills threaten the fragile ecosystems. Now, experts question how close Trinidad and Tobago is to a crunch point. A 2019 report by a US consultancy estimated there were 10 years of gas reserves left. Last year, Stuart Young, then energy minister, said reserves had risen to 11 years, or potentially 20 with efficient extraction. However, the oil cartel Opec’s data indicates that crude oil output is in freefall, and gas production is also declining. Driver says: “On current evidence, Trinidad and Tobago’s reserve-to-production ratio for gas is about 10 years.” By contrast, Guyana and Suriname have discovered vast offshore reserves with hundreds of years left, driving fossil fuel revenues. The discoveries raised hope that new fields could also be developed in Trinidad and Tobago. “You can find new reserves using new technology,” says Driver. “Or drill deeper.” A recent gas find between Tobago and Barbados has increased optimism among fossil fuel advocates. But uncertainties persist since much of the deep Atlantic remains unexplored. Offshore acreage extends 125 miles into the Atlantic, though recovery rates are low – about 10 to 15% for each oilfield. Still, investing heavily in oil and gas exploration has once again become a priority after April’s elections in Trinidad and Tobago restored the United National Congress (UNC) party to government under Persad-Bissessar. Moonilal says the government supports decarbonisation initiatives, such as the Brechin Castle solar farm, the largest in the region, which could supply 10% of the nation’s electricity. However, fossil fuels remain the priority. “We need to be finding more natural gas,” the energy minister says. “Natural gas production declined by 34% from 2015 to 2024, and oil declined by 35% over the same period,” he says. “At the end of 2022, proven gas reserves stood at 57tn cubic feet [1.14bn tonnes]. That represents significant potential for future discoveries, particularly in deepwater acreage. Deepwater exploration is important to us.” Moonilal adds that Trinidad and Tobago hopes to also export its energy expertise. “Guyana, Suriname and Grenada are at different hydrocarbon development stages. We have great human resource expertise and infrastructure. We also have plants that need raw material,” he says. “We see a win-win scenario.” Going against this enthusiasm for oil and gas, environmentalists and economists warn that such reliance on fossil fuels exposes Trinidad and Tobago to ecological harm, price shocks and socioeconomic collapse in a region vulnerable to extreme weather events. The climate crisis has cost Caribbean countries an average of 2.13% of regional GDP annually from 1980 to 2020, according to the OECD. Meanwhile, Trinidad’s per capita emissions rank eighth highest globally, at 22.8 tonnes, which is more than five times the rate of the UK. Aidan Farrell, of the University of the West Indies, says the Caribbean has warmed by about 1C (1.8F) since 1960, with a similar rise expected by 2050. “There is a lot of attention on how we will be able to produce enough food. The government is preparing for more frequent tropical storms, sea-level rise and coastal erosion, where most economic activity, including oil and gas, is located,” he says. Environmentalists argue that the ecological toll is already high. “Oil spills, gas flaring and industrial waste have degraded ecosystems, impacted fisheries and exposed coastal communities to real harm,” says Dizzanne Billy, regional director of Climate Tracker Caribbean. “We’re faced with a troubling paradox: a small island bearing the brunt of climate impacts while contributing significantly to the problem.” The country has faced several environmental disasters in recent years. In 2024, a capsized barge triggered a national emergency, with oil spreading hundreds of miles to the island of Bonaire, contaminating beaches, mangroves and coral. Billy stresses the urgent need to pivot away from fossil fuels. “The urgency isn’t just environmental; it’s economic, social and generational,” she says. “Fossil fuel wealth hasn’t trickled down equally. Frontline communities face underinvestment while absorbing environmental fallout. That’s not just economic – it’s a climate justice issue.” For campaigners such as Billy, a continued focus on fossil fuels is shortsighted. “Our dependence leaves us vulnerable to global price shocks,” she says. The problem is that diversification remains at an early stage. Tourism is marginal outside carnival week in spring, and agriculture needs a dramatic boost to fill the oil void. Still, Sagewan sees the country as a potential exporter of food globally. Michael J Cooper, an expert in energy finance and a former analyst at the energy ministry, sees banking and insurance expanding with a development strategy over the next decade. He lists manufacturing, tourism, film, entertainment, shipping, shipbuilding and ship repair, as well as food production, as viable alternatives. “We have a very educated workforce, with many highly skilled people relative to other developing countries,” he says. “While energy production decline is slow, the government should act early to stimulate other sectors.” Billy calls for a new model that focuses on renewables, regenerative agriculture, digital services, community tourism and the creative economy. “We need policies empowering workers to transition with dignity through re-skilling, support systems and clear pathways into new industries,” she says. “It means shifting power to communities most affected by our current economic model, placing them at the heart of the redesign.”", "section": "Global development", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The ad promotes the communications and marketing agency GreenCurrent Group, which it says supports maritime and energy businesses that invest in liquefied natural gas (LNG), “the most exciting and misunderstood marine fuel”. If this seems unremarkable, the text becomes more absurd further down the page: “Mitigating the practical and reputational risks of LNG investment is possible through robust energy efficiency measures … but there is an easier, more cost effective solution,” it says, offering a “free branding consultation”. Want to learn more? Scan a QR code on the page to view a video. If the ad copy didn’t make you raise your eyebrows, where the QR code leads surely will. It depicts executives from the LNG-powered cruise line Royal Caribbean, which has promoted LNG as the “cleanest burning fossil fuel”, working to protect their reputation and profits amid increasing awareness of the climate crisis. To do so, they do not phase out LNG. Instead, they hire a bright green sponge mascot named Scrubby Greenwash. “Scrub, scrub, scrub sad facts away,” a jingle in the video goes. In case you’ve not yet caught on, GreenCurrent Group does not exist. The spoof ad was placed in the leading maritime and offshore industry publication by the Yes Men, an American-based collective of activist pranksters. The group, which has been engaging in similar stunts for 25 years, is perhaps best known for infiltrating various industry convenings while posing as bigwigs from the World Trade Organization, McDonald’s, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil and other powerful organizations. Since 2003, they have produced three films about their work. The Yes Men’s latest project is a critique of the trade media “for uncritically publishing pro-LNG propaganda”, said Natalie Whiteman, a Yes Men activist who worked on the prank. “A lot of the LNG producers, transporters and industry leaders who read Maritime Executive are trying their hardest to convince the public that LNG is clean, and not a powerful heat-trapping fossil fuel with leakage problems at every step of the supply chain,” she said. “But science keeps telling people the truth, which is bad for business, and also annoying.” It is also a send-up of fossil fuel greenwashing by the cruise industry, which activists have long called out for its toxic pollution and contributions to global warming. “Scrubby helps LNG purveyors, shipping companies, cruise lines – anybody who’s getting a bad rap for investing in LNG – to transform bad news into good news and good news into more money,” said Whiteman sarcastically. “He is greenwash incarnate. Scrubby protects companies from public scrutiny the same way they protect themselves, through a dirty smokescreen of misleading marketing tactics.” The Guardian has approached both Maritime Executive and Royal Caribbean for comment. Whiteman said she hoped the ads remind LNG producers that “profiting off of expediting planetary collapse is generally frowned upon”. The fuel source is almost entirely composed of methane, a planet-heating gas with more than 80 times the global warming power of carbon dioxide in the short term. She noted that the advertisement was not difficult to place – a sign of the “maritime industry’s willingness to push aside ethical responsibilities in order to turn a profit”. “That, or the editors can’t read,” she said. The Yes Men prank comes amid increasing scrutiny of the role of fossil fuel marketing in climate delay. A group called Clean Creatives, for instance, has for years pushed creative agencies to cut ties with the oil and gas industry. It also comes as part of a wave of parody advertisements meant to call attention to the fossil fuel industry’s contributions to the climate crisis. Other notable examples have been produced by the Oscar-winning director Adam McKay’s Yellow Dot Studios, the anti-gas non-profit Gas Leaks Project, and the non-profit media organization Fossil Free Media. Jamie Henn, a founder of Clean Creatives and Fossil Free Media, said the latest Yes Men prank is “great”. “The industry relies on lying to us to push their product,” he said. “Calling out that greenwashing is one of the best strategies we have to combat fossil fuel expansion.” The US is the largest exporter of LNG. Joe Biden last year paused new permits for exports pending a review, a move that his successor, Donald Trump, swept aside on the first day of his second term last month.", "section": "US news", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

But that is what happened to Prof Bethanie Carney Almroth during talks about a global treaty to slash plastic pollution in Ottawa, Canada. The employees of a large US chemicals company “formed a ring” around her, she says. At another event in Ottawa, Carney Almroth was “harassed and intimidated” by a plastic packaging representative, who barged into the room and shouted that she was fearmongering and pushing misinformation. That meeting was an official event organised by the UN. “So I filed the harassment reports with the UN,” said Carney Almroth. “The guy had to apologise, and then he left the meeting. He was at the next meeting.” “That was one example when I filed an official report,” said Carney Almroth, an ecotoxicologist from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. “But I’ve been harassed and intimidated lots of other times, in lots of other contexts, at off-site meetings, at side events, also at scientific conferences, via email and so on.” She has also had to take measures to avoid surveillance at the meetings. “I have a privacy screen protector on my phone, because they will walk behind us and try to film what’s on our screens and see what notes we’re taking, or who we’re chatting with. I would never open my computer in the middle of a room without knowing who is behind me. It’s a high-vigilance, high-stress environment.” These are examples of what numerous sources say is a “total infiltration” of the plastics treaty negotiations by vested industrial interests and corporate lobbyists. The core concern of six insiders who spoke to the Guardian was that the polluters are exerting too much power, not just within the negotiations but also within the UN Environment Programme (Unep), which oversees the negotiations. One source said they were “horrified” by the industry’s influence on policy and the sidelining of real solutions to plastic pollution, calling it “corporate capture”. ‘Distorting knowledge’ The plastics treaty negotiations resume in August in Geneva, Switzerland, having failed to reach agreement at the fifth round of talks in December. At stake is whether the torrent of toxic plastic pollution pouring into the environment can be stemmed. Doing so is not only vital to protect people and the planet but also to curb the climate crisis and the massive global losses of wildlife. But a flood of industry lobbyists and organisations have joined the talks, far outnumbering national delegations and scientists. They assist a group of petrostates, led by Saudi Arabia, in blocking the progress that many nations want, and are part of a wider “petrochemical bloc” that a recent study says “is driving up plastics production, externalising the costs of pollution, distorting scientific knowledge, and lobbying to derail negotiations”. The scale of the plastic problem is staggering. About 450m tonnes of new plastic is produced every year and production is set to triple by 2060 under current growth rates, damaging every aspect of a safe environment. Almost all plastic is made from fossil oil and gas, and emissions from its production drive the climate crisis. Plastic and the toxic chemicals it contains also damage soils, ecosystems and human health, having pervaded the entire world from the top of Mount Everest to the deepest part of the ocean, from human brains to human breast milk. The plastics treaty is being negotiated between the world’s nations, under the auspices of Unep. The negotiations began in 2022, and the talks in Geneva next month will be its sixth major meeting. But since the beginning, the talks have been dogged by a fundamental disagreement. More than 100 nations, backed by more than 1,100 scientists, say a cap on the soaring production of plastic is essential to reduce all the harms they cause. Petrostates and plastic manufacturers reject this and say the focus should be on better managing and recycling of waste. Global climate action to cut carbon emissions is also putting fossil fuel states under pressure to increase other uses for their oil and gas. “The amount of plastic that we’re already producing today is entirely unmanageable,” said David Azoulay, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (Ciel), who has attended the negotiations. “There’s no way, technically or policy wise, that we can manage it. But the companies’ objective is to produce more and miraculously somehow reduce the overall impact.” The expensive recycling technologies proposed by producers are “magical thinking”, he said. Only 9% of plastic is recycled, according to a 2022 OECD report. Azoulay said fossil fuel states and industry do have to be part of the negotiations, but that the process fails to take account of their vested interests. “The fact that there is a major group of business and industry is not problematic, as they are stakeholders. But the fact they’re given, at a minimum, equal standing and equal access to the processes as those of victims of the problem that they’re creating, that is a problem.” He added: “There is a problematic underlying approach in how Unep operates, which is to consider that the people who created the problems, benefited from the problem, have lied about the problem and their responsibility about it for years and decades, are trustworthy partners to solve those problems.” ‘Not an intelligent conversation’ While the negotiating countries will decide the outcome of the treaty talks, Unep is the host and its executive director, Inger Andersen, has a critical and influential guiding role. She has not been spared from criticism. Andersen was accused of an “inappropriate absence of ambition” by more than 100 environmental organisations in April 2023. They also expressed concern about a “lack of transparency regarding who is advising [her] work and the [treaty] secretariat”, which is the group of Unep officials who manage the talks. She was criticised in particular for a statement perceived to undermine the importance of a cap on plastic production, made in September 2024: “We have to have a more refined conversation than just cap [or] no cap, because it’s not an intelligent conversation.” A reduction in production should focus on raw polymer for single use, short-lived products, not “car parts and plane wings”, she said. Critics said her statement contradicted scientific evidence that the environmental impact of plastics begins with extraction and production, not just their use. The environmental organisations complained to Andersen’s boss, the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, in October 2024, saying they had “deep concerns” that her public statements would “narrow the scope” of the treaty and that she had exceeded her role as convener of the negotiations. They did not receive a reply. It was also alleged at the most recent negotiating round, in Busan, South Korea, in December, that Andersen had put pressure on high-ambition countries to give way on their demands for a strong treaty with a cap on plastic production. Andersen responded at the time, saying: “I will meet with everyone at every stage of the way and I will obviously meet the member states and hear them out, from [across] the entire spectrum of the 193 [countries].” Plastics ‘ringleader’ In her convening role, Andersen can do only so much to encourage nations to reach a deal. All the countries have to reach a consensus, but one nation in particular stands out as a block to an effective plastics treaty: Saudi Arabia, the world’s second biggest oil producer. Via its oil company Saudi Aramco, it owns Sabic, one of the world’s biggest producers of plastic. The country has played an increasing role in the plastics treaty negotiations and was described by Politico as the “ringleader” of a small group of oil-rich countries, including Russia and Iran, that blocked proposals for production caps in December. It has also developed a close relationship with Unep in recent years. Andersen made an official visit to Saudi Arabia in January 2024, met Saudi ministers at the UN summit on desertification which was hosted in Riyadh in December 2024 and sought a further ministerial meeting at Davos in 2025 to discuss “strengthening of cooperation”. She was in Riyadh again on 29 June, signing a cooperation agreement on emissions reductions. The country paid Unep $1m to host World Environment Day in 2024, a similar sum paid by previous host nations, and gave the UN agency donations of more than $20m between 2020 and 2024. Some of that was contributions to Unep’s environment fund and covered arrears dating back to 2021. Many countries give money to Unep, which relies on these voluntary contributions for 95% of its income. Most of the rest was instalments from a $25m deal struck in 2019 for Unep to provide expertise in strengthening Saudi Arabia’s environmental protections. After the deal, the head of Unep’s Saudi Arabia office wrote a report which the Guardian has been told expressed concerns about the governance of the money. Unep refused to share the report with the Guardian, saying it was a standard handover report by an official leaving his post and was confidential. In response to the criticisms of Andersen and the plastic treaty talks, a Unep spokesperson told the Guardian: “Unep’s sole focus is on supporting all countries to deliver an impactful treaty that will finally end plastic pollution. Unep continues to facilitate the participation of all relevant stakeholders in the process so we can end plastic pollution for everyone, everywhere.” Inside the plastics treaty negotiations, an official from Saudi Arabia’s ministry of energy was elected in November 2024 to the 10-person bureau of national representatives that run the treaty talks. Azoulay said Saudi Arabia and its allies were undermining the plastics treaty talks. “We’re seeing complete bad faith negotiation. The obstruction [by Saudi Arabia] takes many forms, using their 35 years of experience in derailing climate negotiations, using every procedural tool to prevent progress, and using their vast financial resources to strong-arm and try to influence other countries,” he said. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment. ‘Overwhelming’ lobbying While the petrostate delegations are power players in the meeting rooms and corridors of the treaty negotiations, one group outnumbers every nation: plastic industry lobbyists. At the December talks in Busan there were a record 220 corporate lobbyists in attendance. That was far more than even the host nation’s delegation of 140 and was three times the number of independent scientists. Dow and ExxonMobil sent nine lobbyists between them, according to an analysis by the environmental law group Ciel. Some lobbyists were included in country delegations, rather than with observer organisations, giving them access to sensitive member-state-only sessions, Ciel said. “The overwhelming presence of industry lobbyists skews the treaty’s direction,” a document being circulated among concerned treaty observers and sent to the Guardian says. “This imbalance sidelines scientific evidence in favour of corporate agendas, undermining the treaty’s potential effectiveness.” This warning is not new. Another letter from environmental organisations to Andersen in April 2024 said the lack of a conflict of interest policy enabled industry access to decision-makers. “The participation of businesses from the oil, gas and petrochemical sectors poses a severe threat to the objectives of the treaty,” the letter said. A Unep spokesperson said it was for the negotiating countries themselves to establish a conflict of interest policy, but they had chosen not to do so. In reference to the harassment of Prof Carney Almroth in Ottawa, the spokesperson said a UN code of conduct to prevent such behaviour strictly applied to all plastics treaty meetings. Another lever of influence being pulled by corporate interests is via the system through which Unep gives full access to the negotiations to civil society sectors including women, farmers, Indigenous peoples, children and scientists. The membership of one group has soared recently: business and industry. More than 30 plastic and chemical industry lobby organisations have joined the negotiations since the start of 2023, almost doubling the total number. These include the US Plastics Industry Association, Plastics Europe and national plastic industry groups from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, India, Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia and Korea. The group is co-chaired by a Saudi official. The problem, say critics, is that industry players have deep pockets and clear financial interests. “Lobbying should be called lobbying. It shouldn’t be called ‘society observers’,” said one source close to the negotiations. A report by InfluenceMap in November 2024 found that plastic and fossil fuel industry groups, including ExxonMobil, Sabic, PlasticsEurope and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, “strongly advocated to weaken the ambition of the plastics treaty”. In contrast, the report said: “The consumer goods and retail sectors have strongly supported an ambitious, science-aligned treaty, but [the plastic and fossil fuel sector] at present seems to have the upper hand.” Hotel and flight costs make the treaty negotiations expensive to attend, which is why rich industrial interests can flood the talks with lobbyists while smaller countries, scientists and NGOs struggle to find the funds, said Carney Almroth. “The lobbyists have much more power and much more access,” she said. “They have the economic power to get into rooms I can’t get into. They can speak directly to ministers in ways that I cannot.” Carney Almroth says she is fortunate to be in position to speak out, with a permanent post at a supportive university in Sweden, a safe country where intimidatory lawsuits that have targeted some scientists are difficult for companies to pursue. Many other plastics researchers are afraid to let their voices be heard, she said, fearing legal challenges, loss of funding or career damage. “It’s the tobacco playbook: challenge the science, challenge the messenger, try to silence people, try to undermine people’s credibility.” One business group is particularly influential: the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, whose members include significant plastic, chemical and fossil fuel companies such as Sabic, BASF, BP, Chevron, DuPont, Dow, LyondellBasell and Shell. WBCSD has provided successive co-chairs to the business and industry group. In a statement, the WBCSD said it followed UN rules of procedure, saying: “We support the global ambition to reduce plastic production and use [and] we believe stakeholder participation – including businesses, civil society, academia, and others – is critical to achieving a durable and effective agreement. “Representing companies across industries and throughout the plastics value chain – from raw material producers through to consumer brands and waste management – we engaged as an organization well positioned to share a wealth of private sector knowledge, and expertise and support the process into practical action.” Misunderstandings and misinformation Scientific experts, also keen to share their wealth of knowledge, say they have struggled to keep up with correcting wrong or misleading statements made by industry groups during the talks. There is no official scientific advisory panel for the treaty. Instead, the self-organised Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty (Scept) has attempted to fill the gap. It has 450 members, none funded by industry, and advises the smaller nations plagued by plastic who cannot afford to send scores of delegates to the negotiations. However, in February 2025, Scept wrote to the bureau running the talks and Unep’s Andersen to complain about a lack of access to meetings during the December negotiating round. “Consequently, our ability to follow the negotiations was severely limited,” the scientists said. “We were unable to identify the knowledge gaps, misunderstandings or misinformation that require clarification, often spread by actors with conflicts of interest.” Scientists also said their criticisms of a significant 2023 Unep report on “how the world can end plastic pollution” were ignored. The scientists said the report failed to reflect the whole range of health and environmental impacts of plastic pollution and was over-optimistic about technical solutions to deal with waste plastic. Scept experts had been invited to participate before the report’s publication and provided more than 300 comments. Unep said a “technical issue” meant an email containing Scept’s comments was not received in time for publication. It said it had taken feedback from other experts and denied the report underplayed the impacts of plastic. ‘Threatening our children’s future’ Some countries are gearing up for a fight at the next round of negotiations in Geneva in August. Ninety-five nations issued a “wakeup call for an ambitious plastics treaty” on 10 June at the UN Ocean Conference. “Mountains of plastic [are] suffocating our ecosystem, poisoning food chains and threatening our children’s future,” said France’s environment minister. “This is a pivotal moment. We will not give up.” But Carney Almroth is uncertain about success. “Who knows? We’re planning and strategising for our scientists now and how we’re going to communicate our messages. But I think we can expect chaos and fireworks.” She recalled another incident of harassment at one of the plastics negotiations. A man from the plastics industry, who was not on the guest list, started harassing and shouting at students who were checking people in. “He was leaning over them, angry – it was bad, bad behaviour.” “Everyone I’ve ever been yelled at by is a white man from the global north – every single time. It’s a power dynamic,” she said. “But I don’t cower. I don’t shrink away. And I don’t raise my voice. I respond with references and facts and numbers. I’m also quite tall and when I go to the meetings, I wear heels and I’m taller than most of them. It’s petty, but it’s a game. “I like to think that we are impacting in a positive way, to bring more evidence-based decision making in ways that can help us find solutions that are truly more protective of people and the environment.” You can contact Damian Carrington via email, Signal (dpcarrington.35) or securely via this guide.", "section": "Environment", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The US will send a senior White House official to the 60-country summit, to be co-hosted with the International Energy Agency. Leading oil and gas companies are also invited, along with big technology businesses, and petrostates including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The absence of China – the world’s biggest producer of clean energy technology, and biggest emitter of greenhouse gases – is a blow to the UK, though it is likely to be privately welcomed by the US. The landmark conference, to which 60 countries have been invited, would have marked the first time the US and China had jointly attended a big international forum since Donald Trump began his trade war over tariffs last month. Tzeporah Berman, founder of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: “There is no question that China not coming is a huge setback for global energy cooperation, at a critical moment in history. Trump will send a Maga climate denier to try to distort the conversation and push for increased dependency on US oil and gas, rather than a shift towards cleaner energy systems. “China is leading the world in renewables and electric cars and their refusal to come is a clear signal that they are not going to entertain the Trump administration’s strong-arming to hold back progress.” Robbie MacPherson, a Churchill fellow and former head of the UK’s all-party parliamentary group on climate change, said: “Transitioning away from fossil fuels requires the participation of all emitters. Engaging China is critical to ensuring action that safeguards the planet and unleashes the renewable energy age.” The Guardian understands that China’s non-attendance is down to a diary clash on the part of its senior energy official. But it comes as Labour MPs have been pushing the government to examine the UK’s links with Chinese companies after the apparent abandonment of Scunthorpe’s steelworks by Chinese investors, while Ed Miliband, the UK energy secretary, has come under fire in sections of the media for attempting to forge closer links with China on the supply of energy technologies. The summit on the future of energy security, to take place at Lancaster House in London next Thursday and Friday, has also been slammed by green campaigners, who fear it will be dominated by fossil fuel interests. More than 75 countries were invited, according to an unpublished guestlist seen by the Guardian, and about 60 are likely to attend. Many leading oil and gas producers are on the list, though Russia is excluded. More than 20 developing countries have been invited, including Egypt, Barbados, Zambia and Costa Rica. Only a handful of civil society groups were initially invited, but several more received invitations late on Monday afternoon, after the Guardian made inquiries to the government on Monday morning about their absence. Many of the developing countries invited are those with strong oil and gas interests, such as Nigeria and Algeria, and countries beginning to exploit fossil fuels, or with large untapped reserves, such as Guyana, Senegal and Tanzania, rather than the poorest countries and those most vulnerable to the climate crisis. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “It’s hugely disappointing to see the Labour government hosting a summit about energy but not inviting people who are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. Having just slashed the aid budget, leaving many of the poorest people in the world to face a perilous present and future, the UK government now neglects their presence at a major energy summit.” Berman warned the US was likely to use the summit to push for its booming oil and gas exports. “This summit will be a showdown over whether the IEA and the UK can hold firm against fossil fuel interests and redefine energy security to mean a liberation from dependence on volatile and climate-warming fossil fuels, or chart a safer course,” she said. “The Trump administration is trying to bully its way to continued dependence on US oil and gas – the fact that no one owns the sun and wind is an existential threat to administrations that want to foster dependence and hold on to obscene record profits.” Among the businesses invited are companies that have recently rowed back on their climate commitments, including the oil companies BP, Shell and ExxonMobil; technology companies with strong interests in AI, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft; and banks with large fossil fuel investments, including Bank of America, HSBC and Barclays. The Guardian understands that space constraints at Lancaster House prevented more invitations. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “As we go further and faster in delivering the clean energy transition, Britain is returning to responsible global leadership. That is why we have invited governments, businesses, academics, civil society organisations and others to be part of this dialogue.” A spokesperson for the IEA, the global energy watchdog, said: “The ministers taking part in the summit are from countries across Africa, the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Middle East, including countries on the frontlines of a wide range of energy challenges, such as access, affordability, reliability and climate. “Leaders from a broad cross-section of the whole energy sector, as well as international organisations, civil society groups and beyond will also take part in the discussions in and around the summit, which will seek to build consensus on a holistic approach to energy security.”", "section": "World news", "query": "ExxonMobil", "companies": ["ExxonMobil"]}

The oil company, which paused construction at the site in July last year to tackle technical problems, said it had decided not to restart building after it found the plant would be “insufficiently competitive” to meet demand for “affordable, low-carbon products”. The move to scrap the project in Rotterdam marks another setback for its biofuel designs, after the company cancelled a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project on Singapore’s Bukom Island in March 2023. It comes amid a wider shift away from renewable energy projects in the oil and gas sector as fossil fuel companies pursue higher profits. In March last year Shell watered down a key emissions target, setting out a plan to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade compared with its previous goal of 20%. Shell began construction of the plant in Rotterdam in the Netherlands in 2021, initially expecting to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels, with plans to bring it online in April 2024. This was later pushed back to 2025. Machteld de Haan, the company’s head of downstream, renewables and energy solutions, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products. “This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders.” She added that the company continued “to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system” and that Shell was “one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel”. About half of the biofuels from the plant in Rotterdam were expected to be used for SAF, made from waste cooking oil and animal fat. Proponents of SAF believe it could be crucial for airlines to cut their carbon emissions in line with global climate targets, although critics argue it is not a realistic alternative given the limited timescale to prevent rising emissions from creating a climate disaster. The aviation industry accounts for about 3% of the world’s carbon emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.", "section": "Business", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

There’s the bit where Kate Hudson’s vampy wellness CEO makes Elisabeth Moss masturbate with a giant vibrator while making her stare in the mirror. There’s a cold open starring ex-Showgirl Elizabeth Berkley tearfully hacking off shells that have grown on her skin before getting slaughtered by a masked killer. There’s Hudson serving an elegant dinner of her discarded skin to enthused guests. And then there’s Kaia Gerber turning into a giant lobster … If only Shell was as outrageously fun as that all makes it sound, but there’s something oddly flat about it, actor-turned-director Max Minghella struggling to bring the luridly indulgent pleasures that something as silly as this so obviously needs. It’s never quite obvious what or why Shell is and who it might be for, a cheaply made lark with very little to offer those who weren’t involved in the production, feeling even less necessary given its unfortunate resemblance to The Substance. Both focus on an LA actor struggling to get the attention and work she thinks she deserves in a cruel industry, unfairly critiqued for her looks who is then seduced by a game-changing procedure that provides instant rewards but has horrifying side effects. Even if Fargeat’s version hadn’t premiered last year at Cannes, four months before Minghella’s was unveiled at the Toronto film festival, the comparison would still not be kind. While I was not a particular fan of The Substance (a garishly made, overlong and empty act of provocation mildly saved by a killer lead performance) it had an undeniable stickiness, easily finding its deserved place within the culture (expect it to be one of the most parodied films in next year’s Scary Movie 6). Shell has about the same level of depth to its and-then-what commentary (beauty standards for women are impossibly punishing!), but it can’t match its over-the-top body horror, the film ultimately resembling the kind of no-budget rip-off that would have followed The Substance to the video store back in the day (the Orca to its Jaws, the Critters to its Gremlins etc). It’s strangely led by Moss, an actor not known for her lightness, miscast in a role that requires someone more willing to lean into the absurdity of the territory. She worked with Minghella on The Handmaid’s Tale (one can understand why they both might crave a break from that show’s punishing grimness), and he was so desperate for her to lead that he decided to work around her being noticeably six months pregnant, cue the star being distractingly hidden in a lot of big hoodies and jackets. As an insecure actor seeking to elbow her way into Hollywood with the help of a crustaceous skin routine, she might not really convince, but as the slithering 68-year-old CEO of a life-threatening beauty brand, Hudson is in far greater control. The actor, who remains a perennially underrated force, is again a joy to watch, mastering a specifically LA brand of faux-earnest fakeness backed up by something genuinely sinister and it’s in her all-too-brief scenes that we see what the film could have been. Matched with a more comfortable sparring partner and a sharper script, the film could have played like a deliriously nasty cross between a 50s “woman’s picture” and an 80s creature feature, something Death Becomes Her did so wonderfully well. But the script, from Jack Stanley, who also wrote the similarly limp action thriller Lou, is never as acidic or as smart as it could be, satire kept to its most obvious (the finale hinging on the use of an NDA is funnier in concept than execution). Minghella doesn’t seem confident in what he’s really trying to make, his film as plainly, ploddingly shot as a daytime soap with an equally rubbishy score. If he’s trying to do a knowing carbon copy of a bottom shelf VHS horror, then he hasn’t gone far enough into studied pastiche to sell it as such. Shell should take us all the way over the edge, but it’s too scared to make the jump.

Philippines survivors to sue oil giant in legal first", "date": null, "author": "Jhesset O Enano", "publication": "theguardian.com", "text": "Trixy Elle still weeps when she remembers how she and her family fought for their lives as Typhoon Rai tore across the Philippines days before Christmas four years ago. In a matter of hours, intense rain and storm surges swallowed their home on Batasan Island in Tubigon, Bohol province. Elle, her elderly parents, brother, husband and two young children linked hands as they swam against flood waters in the dead of the night, praying to survive. It was only the beginning of the family’s hardship. “For days, we survived on whatever we could get our hands on, like dead chickens and dead pigs. We didn’t even save a single piece of clothing,” the 34-year-old said. “I would go out to the sea and cry there so my family wouldn’t see me in pain.” Rai, known locally as Super Typhoon Odette, was the strongest storm to hit the Philippines in 2021, killing more than 400 people, displacing nearly 3.2 million and destroying more than 1m homes. It was particularly destructive for communities in Visayas and Mindanao, wrecking hectares of farmland and disrupting health services amid a Covid-19 surge. For years, Elle felt powerless after the cyclone took everything from her family. Now, she is demanding accountability and justice. With 66 other typhoon survivors from island communities in the Philippines, she is suing the fossil fuel company Shell in the UK courts, demanding financial compensation for the losses and damage they experienced under Odette. It is an unprecedented lawsuit in the UK and globally, as the first civil claim to directly link polluting companies to deaths and personal injuries that have already happened in the global south. Other climate lawsuits have so far focused on future harms and risks. The legal team representing the survivors delivered the letter before action to Shell, which is domiciled in London, on Wednesday. The letter invites the company to respond to the allegations. If no agreement is reached between the parties, the survivors will file a case before the UK high court in December. The claim argues that Shell’s polluting business has contributed to anthropogenic climate change, which intensified the typhoon’s impact. Using Philippine laws, it asserts that the firm has violated the constitutional rights of the claimants to a healthy environment, and that it caused harm by failing to mitigate its emissions and engaging in climate disinformation and obfuscation of climate science. The case also seeks potential injunctive relief to prevent further violations to human rights. Leaked internal documents suggest Shell knew of the extensive negative impacts of fossil fuel production and consumption at least 60 years ago but continued to expand and significantly profit from its business. “The fact that they continued such acts despite knowing the harm they would cause, coupled with deliberately misinforming the public, can be considered acting contrary to certain provisions of Filipino law,” said Greg Lascelles, a partner at Hausfeld who leads the legal team. A Shell spokesperson denied allegations that the company had earlier knowledge of climate change. “The suggestion that Shell had unique knowledge about climate change is simply not true. The issue of climate change and how to tackle it has been part of public discussion and scientific research for decades,” they said in a statement. Filipino claimants in the Odette lawsuit, however, argue that despite Shell knowing the impact of increased emissions, it still expanded its fossil fuel operations, hid from the public what it knew and actively undermined scientific consensus on the causes and effects of the climate crisis through its direct involvement in the fossil fuel industry and lobbying. While climate lawsuits have exponentially increased globally over recent years, the Odette case stands out as a claim that draws from robust attribution science. An independent study by scientists from Imperial College London, the University of Sheffield and the Grantham Institute concluded that anthropogenic climate change has more than doubled the likelihood of extreme weather events like Odette. The case is also supported by a pioneering report from the Philippines’ Commission on Human Rights, which conducted the world’s first investigation on the responsibility of 47 of the world’s largest oil, gas and cement producers, including Shell, for human rights violations related to the climate crisis. In 2022, the commission concluded that polluters had a moral and legal obligation to address climate harms. Climate litigation against companies has been on the rise globally, with lawsuits targeting corporations or their directors and officers. Eleven “polluter pays” cases were filed in 2024, according to researchers from the London School of Economics. This year the verdict in a case against the German energy company RWE found that polluters could be held liable for their carbon emissions. But so far no company has had to pay for losses and damages linked to the climate crisis. As climate harms mount, courts are becoming the new battlefield for climate survivors seeking accountability, said Tessa Khan, a climate change lawyer and executive director of Uplift, which supports the claimants. “Courts are always the last venue of resort. It takes incredible courage and tenacity to pursue this legal option,” she said. “But it will remain so as long as communities are finding that companies and governments in the global north are not fulfilling their responsibility and moral duties.” In the Philippines, Elle and her family are still struggling to get back on their feet. They have stayed on Batasan, which has become known as a sinking island. During high tide on sunny days, rising seawater enters homes and schools. Families have adapted by building their houses a few feet higher than the ground. Everyone, including Elle, is adamant they will stay. “My motivation is my children’s future. I don’t want my children to suffer again,” Elle said. The harrowing experience of surviving Odette lingers on with her two sons, now 13 and 17, who hide in fear every time they hear rumbling thunder. For her, their case is a hopeful light after a long period of darkness. “Maybe this fight is my purpose in my second life after surviving Odette,” she said. “With this case, I hope that Shell and other companies now see us, the people who are suffering because of their business. We are now fighting back.”", "section": "World news", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

In a letter to Shell, the Dutch climate non-profit Milieudefensie vowed to take legal action because the company has 700 oil and gas projects in development that will continue to drive up carbon emissions despite efforts to slow global heating. It revealed its plan to return to the Dutch courts six months after the oil company successfully overturned a ruling in favour of the green group that called on Shell to reduce its emissions. It is currently waiting for a ruling from the Netherlands supreme court on the case in which Milieudefensie argued that Shell should reduce its emissions by 45% in line with the Paris climate agreement. Donald Pols, the director of Milieudefensie, said the ruling late last year had prompted the group to “pick up the gauntlet and take Shell to court once again”. Pol said: “At a time in which the climate crisis continues to rage on because of the actions of companies such as Shell, every new oil or gas field is simply one too many.” The court said at the time that a company could be compelled to take measures to protect the environment that go beyond current legislation. However, it added that demanding a specific percentage reduction in emissions was not realistic. Instead, the group has called for a ban on Shell’s new oil and gas fields rather than setting an emissions target. “We simply cannot sit back and wait while Shell continues on its fossil path. Shell remains fully committed to new oil and gas fields, despite warnings from scientists that this will have disastrous consequences. Now is the critical moment to curb the climate crisis,” Pol said. A spokesperson for Shell confirmed that it had received the letter but stressed that no lawsuit has been filed. “As we have said many times, what Milieudefensie wants will not advance the energy transition. As the world continues to use oil and gas to heat homes and to transport goods and people, the transition needs collaboration between governments, businesses and consumers. By working together, with effective government policies, the world can move to low-carbon products and maintain a secure supply of affordable energy,” the spokesperson added. The lawsuit is the latest legal row between Shell and climate campaigners after the oil company settled a $2.1m (£1.6m) lawsuit against Greenpeace after its campaigners boarded an oil rig as part of a peaceful protest last year. Shell in 2023 successfully quashed a lawsuit brought by the environmental law charity ClientEarth when the high court in London refused permission to bring a case against the energy company.", "section": "Business", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

The oil company has been discussing the feasibility and merits of a takeover of BP with its advisers in recent weeks, according to a report from Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter. If this were to happen, it would mark one of the biggest deals ever in the oil and gas industry. Speculation about a possible takeover comes as BP’s shares have suffered this year. They have fallen by more than 30% in the past 12 months as a turnaround plan under the chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, has failed to inspire investors and oil prices have fallen. Shell may also wait for BP to reach out for another possible suitor to make the first move, those familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Deliberations are allegedly still in the early stages, and Shell could decide to focus on share buybacks and smaller acquisitions rather than such a big merger, according to the report. The combination of Britain’s biggest oil companies would be one of the largest deals ever in the sector. Shell’s market value of £145.6bn is more than double that of BP, at £55.9bn. A spokesperson for Shell told the Guardian: “As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.” A spokesperson for BP declined to comment. In February, Auchincloss promised to “fundamentally reset” BP’s strategy, with the changes expected to include a watering down of its climate commitments and the pursuit of new fossil fuel projects in an attempt to bolster its market value. The company’s profits dropped by almost 50% in the first three months of this year to $1.4bn (£1bn), down from $2.7bn in the same period last year. Its flagging share price has also made the company a target for the New York hedge fund Elliott Management. The shares have lagged behind other oil and gas firms in recent years after its former chief executive Bernard Looney set BP on course to become a net zero energy company.

On Friday, Shell reported adjusted profits of $5.6bn in its first quarter, down 28% compared with the same period last year but ahead of what City analysts had been expecting.

In an official statement to markets on Thursday, the company doubled down on the previous day’s denials that it was planning a bid, after media reports that it was in early talks with its competitor to create a £200bn UK oil supermajor. Shell said it had not been actively considering making an offer for BP, adding it “has not made an approach to, and no talks have taken place with, BP with regard to a possible offer”. Shell toughened its stance against the growing market speculation by making the statement under rule 2.8 of the UK’s takeover code, a set of rules governing mergers and takeovers of listed companies. The company said it would now be bound by the restrictions set out under the rule, which means Shell will be blocked from making a formal offer to buy BP for at least half a year except in specific circumstances. Shell could make an offer sooner than six months if there was a material change of circumstances, including if another company made a bid for BP, or if Shell had the agreement of BP’s board. The official denial came after Shell issued a statement late on Wednesday to quash media reports it was in early talks to buy BP. The company referred to a Wall Street Journal report that first raised claims of early talks between the companies as “further market speculation”. It added that “no talks are taking place”. The market has been gripped by speculation that Shell would use its recent run of better-than-expected profits to make a play for its struggling rival while its market value is low. BP has lost almost a third of its market value in the past year and is now worth about £58bn, after a turnaround plan by its chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, failed to convince investors that it could recover from a botched attempt to become a net zero energy company. Its ill-fated green strategy was first put in place in early 2020 by the former chief executive Bernard Looney, who began to backtrack from his pledge to cut BP’s oil production by the end of the decade when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 led to soaring global energy prices. Looney was later ousted by the BP board for failing to disclose personal relationships with his staff. The tribulations had already made BP a target for the feared activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which had been expected to use its multimillion-pound stake in the company to call for sweeping changes, including a new chair. Helge Lund, who appointed Looney and was in charge while the share prices plunged, announced plans to step down as the chair shortly before shareholders at BP’s AGM in April voted for him to leave. He is expected to exit the role officially next year but a successor has yet to be named. Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, was earlier this year forced to deny the company’s rumoured plans of a BP takeover, saying the company was more interested in buying back its own shares than buying a rival. According to the new WSJ report, talks between company representatives were moving forward slowly while BP carefully considered an approach, but it added that a final deal to create a new oil company remained far from certain. Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell, said a BP tie-up with Shell would be a politically more palatable outcome for the UK government than if a foreign-owned entity made a bid. “If Shell doesn’t move on BP, there’s a good chance someone else will,” he said. However, he suggested that if Shell were to move ahead with a bid for BP in the future it might struggle to get all of its large shareholders to support the takeover. “Investors might not welcome the acquisition of a messy company and it would make Shell a higher-risk investment,” Coatsworth said. “There might be several years of management distraction on integrating the business and finding buyers for any inherited assets that are deemed non-core. Investors might simply take the view that Shell is already well-served by its current assets and a BP takeover would give it indigestion.” A Shell spokesperson said: “We remain focused on delivering more value with less emissions through performance, discipline and simplification.”", "section": "Business", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

The so-called oil supermajors are reported to be discussing a potential deal after speculation earlier this year that Shell was considering a bid for its struggling rival, which would mark an end for the 120-year-old company. The talks over a potential megamerger, reported by the Wall Street Journal, could lead to one of the largest takeover deals in UK corporate history and a British oil company worth well over £200bn. According to the report, talks between company representatives are moving forward slowly while BP carefully considers the approach, but a final deal to create a new oil giant remains far from certain. A spokesperson for Shell referred to the report as “further market speculation”, and added that “no talks are taking place”. However, they did not say whether talks had previously taken place. Market commentators have in recent months speculated that Shell might use its record-high profits to buy BP, which has long been marked by analysts as a potential takeover target as its failed green energy plan, disappointing financial results and boardroom turmoil have sent its share price tumbling. The company has lost almost a third of its market value in the past year, and is now worth about £58bn, after a turnaround plan by its chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, failed to convince investors that it could recover from a botched attempt to become a net-zero energy company. The embattled oil company has already emerged as a target for the feared activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which amassed a stake in BP earlier this year to call for a major strategic overhaul to rescue its flailing market value. BP’s doomed green strategy was first put in place in early 2020 by the former chief executive Bernard Looney, whose promise to cut BP’s oil production by the end of the decade backfired when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 led to soaring global energy prices. Looney was forced to backtrack on the company’s green ambitions before he was ousted by the BP board for failing to disclose personal relationships with his staff. BP’s shareholders have since turned on the company’s chair, Helge Lund, who appointed Looney and oversaw the share price plunge. Lund announced plans to step down from the company in April amid shareholder pressure. Auchincloss has since promised investors to cut more than £4bn from its low-carbon investment plans in favour of a return to growing fossil fuel production. The plan has angered green groups and has done little to appease BP’s investors. Auchincloss has also warned that his plan would include cutting thousands of jobs from BP’s global workforce, amounting to 5% of its staff. Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, pledged to grow its oil and gas business leading to record profits during the global energy crisis as well as hefty shareholder payouts for investors and a market value of more than £150bn. Sawan was forced to deny Shell’s rumoured plans to take over its smaller rival earlier this year, saying the company was more interested in buying back its own shares than buying another company. He told the Financial Times earlier this year: “We will always look at these things, but you are also looking to see what is the alternative. Right now, buying back Shell [shares] for us continues to be absolutely the right alternative to go for.” A Shell spokesperson said: “As we have said many times before we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.” BP declined to comment on the reports of a takeover.", "section": "Business", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

Next year may be different", "date": null, "author": "Nils Pratley", "publication": "The Guardian", "text": "BP is a sitting duck for a takeover bid by most criteria. Its share price has underperformed rivals’ for years. The latest strategic “re-set” was a bits-and-pieces production involving disposals, which do not happen overnight, plus a dilution of green energy ambitions that upset one sub-set of shareholders and didn’t go far enough according to another. Meanwhile, the chair, Helge Lund, is set to exit next year after being pursued by an activist investor. So Shell, the most credible possible bidder by a distance, would be asleep at the wellhead if it were not taking a look and calculating what costs could be removed, which development licences it fancies and how regulators and governments might react. That’s standard stuff, and Shell, one assumes, will have maintained a version of such modelling for about 20 years, which is roughly as long as tales of a combination of the two companies have been running. But here comes a response to media reports that was as definitive as these things tend to come: Shell says it has “no intention” of making an offer for BP, a statement that takes it ofside as a bidder for six months under Takeover Panel rules. One should still remember the small print about the circumstances in which the Panel’s Rule 2.8 does not apply, because two are not unimaginable – somebody else taking a pop, or BP’s board agreeing to a bid. But Shell also said it “has not been actively considering making an offer” and “has not made an approach”, which was a strong signal to the market to cool its jets. The share prices of the two companies, after a brief burst of excitement in New York trading, went back to where they were. We’re also back to the same place in terms of pin-pointing the biggest obstacle to a deal: Shell’s share price. Or, more precisely, it is Shell management’s loud declarations that its shares are dirt cheap and therefore should be bought by the company itself in large quantities for cancellation. Buy-backs have run at $3bn or more for 14 quarters in a row. “I have said in the past that we want to be value hunters,” Wael Sawan, the chief executive, said in May. “Today, value hunting – in my view – is buying back more Shell.” That doesn’t in itself rule out mega bids, but it sets “an incredibly high bar”, as the finance director, Sinead Gorman, put it. The thinking makes sense. Any £60bn-plus bid for an ailing rival would inevitably involve Shell issuing oodles of new paper. That is tricky to justify if you genuinely believe your acquisition currency is seriously undervalued and you add value by maintaining buy-backs. BP is not a must-do deal for Shell, as argued here previously. The arithmetic might work if BP’s board agreed to roll over and be bought at a tiny takeover premium – but that possibility must be remote. None of which is to deny the industrial logic in a combination. There probably are huge costs that could be ripped out. Panmure Liberum’s analyst notes that BP has more than 100,000 staff, yet Shell delivers far higher returns with 96,000. Equally, one could imagine Shell offering to buy chunks of BP’s oil and gas acreage but not the whole company, something that is not excluded under Rule 2.8. But the takeover dance feels like it requires Shell’s share price to be higher to make the numbers work. On that front, the recent trend is in the right direction but more progress is surely needed, which is why a “nothing for six months” statement is costless from Shell’s point of view. Next year the arithmetic may stack up more easily. As for BP, this is starting to feel like a proper crisis. Its share price has drifted even lower since the unveiling in February of the supposedly “exciting” new strategy. Disposals to ease the strain on the balance sheet remain a work in progress. One assumes a new chair, with authority to re-set the re-set, will be found before the six months are up. But the appointment can’t come soon enough.", "section": "Business", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

Prof Hankamer, from the Institute of Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland, is one of a growing number of people around the world exploring ways living organisms and their products can be integrated into our built environment – from algae-based bricks to straw or fungi wall panels, and render made from oyster shells. “Biomaterials”, broadly speaking, are materials made using biological matter, and a small group of engineers and designers are turning to them for their “visual richness”, alongside their eco-credentials. With traditional construction materials such as cement and steel coming under scrutiny for their environmental impact, architects and designers working to develop biomaterials say one benefit is the biological “ingredients” capture CO2 as they’re grown. Once the ingredient (microalgae or seaweed, for example) is harvested and made into a building material, it’s often “dead” and now acts as carbon storage. But materials are also being designed so the organism continues to live – or has other organisms then living on it – meaning it continues sucking up CO2 and emitting oxygen over its lifespan. So what are the new biomaterials sprouting up, and how long until you might see them on the market? Algae and seaweed: from bricks to bioplastics In the US, Prometheus Materials is already using microalgae to create a cement replacement for construction blocks, while macroalgae – or seaweed – is being used for housing in Mexico. Danish company Søuld is producing acoustic panels from eelgrass, inspired by a roof thatching technique used on Læsø island dating back to the 1600s. In Australia, Hankamer’s team runs a facility testing green algae production systems. Some of their microalgae has gone to Müge Belek Fialho Teixeira, an associate professor at Queensland University of Technology whose team has used it to create breeze blocks called RoboBlox. The blocks are 3D printed, allowing for bespoke designs. Prototypes displayed at an international construction exhibition in 2024 looked like a more delicate, organic-shaped, terracotta-coloured version of the decorative mid-century Besser blocks that line many a suburban street. Using 3D printing means the blocks are slower to make than traditional mass-produced breeze blocks that all use the same mould. Teixeira says this has so far deterred potential investors they’ve spoken with, and the blocks are on pause until they can secure a partnership. They also need to do an economic analysis to compare the cost of production with existing products. At the University of Technology Sydney, Dr Kate Scardifield and colleagues have taken seaweed from an industrial cultivation plant and combined it with oyster shells from the NSW coast food industry to create a mottled seaweed-green concrete-like brick. They’re testing a range of seaweed waste products, from sheeting and cladding to interior tiles and acoustic panelling, at various scales to ensure they meet industry standards. There are multiple stages new technologies must pass to move from the lab to commercialisation; Scardifield says they’re working with industry partners to progress these products but can’t speculate how long they will take. One algae product already in use is a decorative film developed by Other Matter. The organic, marbled material has recently been used in skincare brand Aēsop’s new store in Hainan, China, where sheets of the decorative algae-film (sent rolled in a poster tube) were applied over backlit glass on the walls and pillars. “We’ve been able to create wonderfully deep fluid patterning reminiscent of marble but without the heavy environmental cost or logistical limitations of quarried stone,” director of Other Matter Jessie French says. The sheets can also be melted down for reuse. Oyster shell walls Using oyster shells donated by restaurants and seafood wholesalers, Australian company Mineral Fox has developed a range of renders for interior walls in various textures, ranging from natural pinks and browns to off-whites and pale khaki, with flecks of opalescent oyster shells performing something of a terrazzo effect in some finishes. Founder Karmin Kenny says the render has been used in the Brisbane office of global architectural firm Arup, and is due for use in some large commercial and residential projects in Sydney, including one in line to be the largest-scale use of recycled oyster shell render in the world. Prices begin at about $180/sqm, including the cost of materials and labour for installation, going up to $400/sqm for complex architectural finishes. This puts it very much in the realm of premium products: HiPages suggests the average range of traditional rendering (made of cement, sand, water and lime) is between $30 and $150/sqm in Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Living materials In the UK, University College London’s Brenda Parker and collaborator Marcos Cruz, an architect and professor of innovative environments, say the next frontier is “engineered living materials”, where the biological matter continues to live beyond installation and respond to its environment – or the material may simply be designed to attract living things. For example, their Poikilohydric Living Walls, now installed in a house in Scotland and a primary school in south London as study sites, are designed to be colonised by algae, moss and lichen. The plants can remain dormant for long periods of time and then revitalise when there’s rainfall – meaning they don’t need irrigation systems. “Rather than creating completely new materials, we’ve worked with the most available material on Earth – concrete – and looked at different ways of doing carbon offsets,” says Cruz. Prantar Tamuli, a pastdoctoral student of Parker and Cruz, also developed wall panels made of a semi-translucent material embedded with living cyanobacteria. As the bacteria are still alive, it continues to photosynthesise, drawing in carbon dioxide and producing calcium carbonate, which strengthens the panels. Prototypes have been installed at St Andrews Botanic Garden in Scotland. Parker, an associate professor of sustainable bioprocess design, says the evolving and individual looks of living biomaterials is part of their beauty – and the benefits go beyond capturing carbon. “There’s a reason we enjoy spending time in nature, we know it has benefits for us.” Biomaterials, she says, puts the built environment on a “continuum with nature”. Bamboo and fungi panels Fungi, meanwhile, has gained popularity as a leather alternative, but it’s also drawing increasing interest for use in building materials. Co-founder of the Bio-Based Materials Design Lab at the University of Western Australia, associate professor Rosangela Tenorio has created building panels using bamboo and mycelium, the root-like fibres that grow from fungi. The mycelium isn’t alive in the panels, which allays concerns about potential negative health effects, and they can be used externally when waterproofed with existing natural coatings. But they’ve so far struggled to attract Australian funding, outside the university’s support, to build at a large-enough scale for testing, which is why Tenorio will soon travel to Timor-Leste to build a prototype building with the panels. Houses made of straw Back in Australia, straw – a traditional building material on other continents – is slowly finding a market. Director of Viva Homes Sam Vivers says they’ve built 70 straw-bale houses and a further 41 using straw panels. There are different finish options for the prefabricated panels, including lime render or plywood cladding. The rendered panels have also been tested for fire resistance by CSIRO and are allowed for builds in areas classified as extreme bushfire risk. “As a relatively new and unconventional product in Australia they don’t fall within the National Construction Code, so we provide a ‘performance solution’ for each build which satisfies the building regulations,” Vivers says. Another Australian company, Durra Panel, makes non-structural wall and ceiling panels from reclaimed wheat straw, including a range incorporating biochar. Despite being used in thousands of projects – from homes to sports stadiums, recording studios, and even the media centre at the 2000 Sydney Olympics – general manager Ainslee Haslemore says their product is “still relatively unknown” to many in the construction industry and among consumers. Barriers to biomaterials Irma Del Valle Nachon of sustainable architecture firm Breathe says “many biomaterials inherently carry a distinctive organic aesthetic”. “We see this as an opportunity for both clients and designers to embrace the unique, honest visual and tactile qualities these materials offer.” The firm recently used the hemp-based panel HexCore for a benchtop in a circular studio fitout, but there are challenges to using biomaterials, she says. “We’ve encountered significant barriers to specifying them in projects, ranging from limited availability, long lead times, higher costs – compared to more readily available ‘business as usual’ construction materials – and the lack of certification needed to meet Australian standards and the building code.” QUT professor Tim Schork, a member of the international Building with Blue Biomass network, says building regulations were written for conventional materials, but many biomaterials require different use and maintenance – making testing and certification difficult. In contrast Paul Nicholas, who leads the network and is an associate professor at the Royal Danish Academy School of Architecture, says the Danish government has been reviewing regulations to create faster pathways for biomaterials. Danish architectural firms are more open to using experimental products, he says, and Denmark even has a “mini-Bunnings” purely for bio-based building materials. Schork is hopeful Australia can have similar support from the larger building industry to support real change here too.

Europe’s biggest oil company handed its investors the multibillion-dollar windfall despite reporting weaker-than-expected profits of $23.7bn. It has faced calls from climate campaigners to divert more of its profits to renewable energy projects and away from shareholder payouts. The fossil fuel investors, which include major pension funds, are now in line for a 4% dividend increase alongside share buybacks of $3.5bn over the first three months of the year. This could put investors in line for payouts of around $23bn in the year ahead, assuming that its buybacks remain at about $3.5bn a quarter. Shell’s payouts lifted its shares 2.6% and helped the FTSE 100 index hit a record closing price of 8,646.88 points, a 1.04% gain. Campaigners at Global Witness, which analysed the company’s financial reports, said the company had chosen to ply its investors with cash rather than increase its investments in clean energy alternatives. Shell’s spending on oil and gas eclipsed its spending on renewables by more than seven times last year, according to the group’s analysis. Shell spent $18.3bn on its traditional fossil fuel businesses last year, and just over $2.5bn on “renewables and energy solutions” over the same period. The lucrative quarter for Shell shareholders marks the 13th consecutive quarter in which Shell has given its investors buybacks of more than $3bn, despite worse than expected earnings from its oil and gas operations. The company reported adjusted annual earnings of $23.7bn for 2024, missing the forecasts of City analysts who had expected an annual profit of just over $24bn for the year. This represents another sharp drop in annual profits, after its full-year earnings tumbled to $28.25bn in 2023 from a record high of almost $40bn the year before, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled global oil and gas markets. Shell has continued to offer its investors healthy returns despite the steady fall in its annual profits. The company’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, said Shell’s cashflows have remained strong, despite the profit slump, and it had shaved $3bn in costs from the business. Shell’s carbon emissions were “flat” compared with the previous year, he said. Profits are expected to be lower for all major oil companies because of weaker market prices. Oil and gas prices have drifted lower over the last year despite the war in Ukraine and an escalation of the Gaza conflict. The US benchmark price for gas, known as Henry Hub, averaged $2.33 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) down from $2.57 in 2023 – and well below the $6.50/MMBtu average in 2022 after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Oil prices last year averaged $80.20 a barrel, and tumbled to an average of $74.40 in the final quarter, after averaging $82.60 in 2023 and more than $100 a barrel in 2022 as war broke out in Ukraine. Alice Harrison, the head of fossil fuel campaigns at Global Witness, said the extreme weather and fire events of the past year had served as a reminder of “how exposed we all are to fossil-fuel driven climate extremes”. “You would think this devastation would serve as a wake-up call to corporate giants like Shell, to start prioritising the energy transition we need to safeguard life on Earth. Instead, they’re continuing to rake in billions from planet-wrecking oil and gas. “As we approach 10 years since the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, it’s high time governments held oil giants like Shell to account. Rather than propping up the climate-wrecking fossil fuel industry, we need governments to make polluters pay for the damage they have already caused, and steer us towards a cleaner, greener future,” Harrison said. Campaigners at Greenpeace have called for oil companies to use their multibillion-dollar profits to pay for the damage caused by the climate crisis, which is fuelled by oil and gas production. Elena Polisano, who leads the campaign, said: “Oil companies like Shell are causing the climate crisis, and they have the billions necessary to fund the clean-up of homes and communities – yet they don’t pay a penny for the loss and damage they cause. The UK government must act in the interests of the people it represents and make fossil fuel companies – not taxpayers – pay for the damage caused by flooding and other climate disasters.”", "section": "Business", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

With the wind battering her village of Rizal, about 10 miles east of Manila in the Philippines, and water swirling through the rooms below them, they had no choice but to wait, hoping that someone would come to rescue them and hundreds of their neighbours. “We did not have shelter, we did not have food … we just had to wait for the government for two days,” Carbonel said. “It is not easy, no electricity, no light, we just wait for the sun to rise. The children were scared, we had never experienced anything like this.” Carbonel was speaking to the Guardian as Greenpeace activists and youth leaders from the Philippines protested outside the oil firm Shell’s headquarters in London on Wednesday demanding “accountability from major polluters and justice for all the loss and damage they have caused”. The Philippines has always been hit by typhoons, but as the climate emergency has worsened the storms have become more violent, with more destructive winds and floods. Last year in a record-breaking typhoon season, six storms battered the country in just a month. The super-typhoon Man-yi brought winds of up to 120mph and drove more than 650,000 people from their homes. In all, the storm season – “supercharged” by climate change, according to experts – affected more than 13 million people, destroyed lives and livelihoods and cost an estimated $500m. Carbonel, who is president of her local homeowners association, said the storms had grown much worse since she was younger. “When I was a child I did not experience this type of strong typhoon,” she said. “We are scared but we are already preparing, we prepare food and medicines and water.” A sofa belonging to Carbonel was one of the climate-wrecked household items put in giant glass boxes filled with water outside Shell’s headquarters on Wednesday. The possessions, which also included a television, shoes and a teddy bear, had all been destroyed in the latest typhoon season. As Shell staff arrived for work, speakers played the sounds of children laughing, and people cooking or watching TV, which had been recorded in the Philippines. Those noises were then replaced with sirens like those used in the Philippines to warn people of impending floods. Activists then smashed the glass cases, allowing the “flood” waters to spill out in front of the building. Greenpeace UK’s climate campaigner, Maja Darlington, said: “The world is near breaking point and it is oil and gas giants like Shell, who pocket tens of billions every year from burning fossil fuels that drive this climate chaos, that are to blame. It’s time they coughed up and paid their climate debts.” Bon Gibalay, a youth leader from Bohol in the Philippines, who was part of the protest, said: “For far too long communities like mine have weathered climate impact after climate impact, while companies like Shell continue to profit from fuelling the climate crisis. By delivering these precious possessions, damaged and destroyed by typhoons supercharged by the climate crisis, from the Philippines directly by the doors of Shell, we demand accountability from major polluters and justice for all the loss and damage they have caused.” During the latest storms, Carbonel’s house was spared the worst damage and she spent the night walking the streets warning neighbours through a loudhailer. Ten families whose homes were badly hit sheltered in her home until the storm receded. With a few months to go before the next storm season is due, she says all she can do is hope the world takes notice and the big oil companies take responsibility for what they are doing. “How can we ask those kind of people to pay? They are in government, in big companies, they are powerful, they are rich. For someone like me, what can I do? I just tell my children don’t worry, just pray to God [that the next] typhoon will miss us. I just tell them to pray.”", "section": "Environment", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

The oil company threatened to sue Greenpeace for $2.1m (£1.6m) in damages in one of the biggest legal threats against the group after its campaigners occupied a moving oil platform off the coast of the Canary Islands for 13 days to protest against the damage to the climate caused by Shell. As part of the final settlement, Greenpeace will accept no liability and pay no money to Shell. The group will instead donate £300,000 to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Shell said the company was pleased that the dispute was settled and that a payment in lieu of the costs it incurred “can benefit a charity working on safety at sea”. The spokesperson added: “For Shell, the right to protest is fundamental and has never been at issue.

He was also clear that Greenpeace could still protest from a safe distance and their human rights were not infringed.” Greenpeace had described the “intimidation lawsuit” as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (Slapp), which is a type of lawsuit typically brought by wealthy corporations to silence critics. The campaign group also faces a legal threat in the US from Energy Transfer, a US pipeline company, over the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016, which Greenpeace claims represents “an existential threat” to its presence in the US. The green organisation is also being sued by the Italian oil company ENI. As part of its settlement with Shell, Greenpeace has signed a legally binding commitment to Shell UK and the high court that prohibits the group from carrying out similar actions at or near key oil and gas platforms in the North Sea for five to 10 years. Greenpeace said the four sites in question are mostly declining fields where the group had no plans to take direct action, and that Greenpeace would continue to campaign against Shell including in the North Sea. The Greenpeace UK co-executive director, Areeba Hamid, said: “This settlement shows that people power works. Thousands of ordinary people across the country backed our fight against Shell, and their support means we stay independent and can keep holding big oil to account. We’ve ensured not a penny of our supporters’ money will go to Shell, and all funds raised will be used to continue campaigning against the fossil fuel industry and other big polluters. “This legal battle might be over, but big oil’s dirty tricks aren’t going away. With Greenpeace facing further legal battles around the world, we won’t stop campaigning until the fossil fuel industry stops drilling and starts paying for the damage it is causing to people and planet.”", "section": "Business", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

Europe’s largest oil and gas producer will hand its chief executive, Wael Sawan, a package worth £8.6m for last year, from £7.9m in 2023. The pay hike, labelled “obscene” by green campaigners, was awarded after Sawan scrapped Shell’s green targets in favour of a renewed focus on fossil fuels. Sawan told investors he planned to increase Shell’s oil and gas production by 1% a year until 2030, in contrast with a previous target of letting oil production decline by 1-2% a year by 2030 compared with its production in 2019. He also planned to increase its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 4-5% a year through to 2030, despite warnings that global carbon emissions would need to fall by 45% by the end of the decade to keep the world on track with internationally agreed climate targets. Shell plans to grow its business even as it shrinks spending to keep costs low. The plans include cutting its scheduled investment in low-carbon energy from 20% of its capital expenditure to 10% by 2030. Sawan’s decision to redouble Shell’s efforts on producing fossil fuels, while watering down its green targets and cutting its costs has helped its share price outpace rivals in recent years. Shell plans to shower its shareholders with larger paydays after setting out plans to pay out 40-50% of the cashflow from its operations, up from a previous target of 30-40%. “It comes down to confidence,” Sawan told investors at the company’s capital markets day in New York. “Confidence that through performance, discipline and simplification we will deliver what we say. Confidence that we are strongly positioning Shell for the future, resilient irrespective of how the energy system evolves.” Sawan said last year that if his plan to revive Shell’s fortunes by focusing its spending on fossil fuels failed he would consider “all options” to catch up with highly valued rivals in the US, including shifting the company’s listing to New York. The company plans to strip out a cumulative $5bn-$7bn (£3.9bn-£5.4bn) a year in costs by the end of 2028, and lower its spending to $20bn-$22bn a year over the next three years. Under Sawan’s leadership, Shell has been criticised for watering down its pledge to cut carbon emissions, and has cut hundreds of jobs at its low-carbon division. Patrick Galey, the investigations lead at Global Witness, said Sawan’s “obscene” pay packet “will feel like a slap in the face for millions”. “Instead of allowing oil giants to hand out billions to wealthy shareholders and shower their bosses with lavish pay cheques, governments should be making them pay climate damages,” he said. Shell handed $8.7bn to its shareholders through dividends last year, and spent $13.9bn on share buy-backs. It is to stick with its goal of raising dividends by 4% a year. Its emissions were largely unchanged last year at about 1.2bn metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent, according to its annual report published on Tuesday. Its Scope 3 emissions – from using the fuel it sells – reached 1.1bn tonnes, more than double the emissions produced by the whole of Great Britain.", "section": "Business", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

It stinks. “This is the water that Shell has left for my people,” said the ruler of the Ogale community in Ogoniland, Nigeria. “This is poison, and they are spending millions of dollars to pay the best lawyers in the world so that they will not clean my land.” For the past three and a half weeks, lawyers for Shell have argued at the high court that their client cannot be held responsible for an environmental catastrophe in Ogale, which has suffered from decades of spills and pollution from oil extraction. For most of that time, Okpabi was there too, watching proceedings in court 63, a nondescript room lined with empty bookcases. Between hearings, he met journalists and activists to spread word of the health crisis his people face. “A people have been completely destroyed: people’s way of life destroyed; people’s only drinking water, which is the underground water aquifer, has been poisoned; people’s farmland has been completely poisoned; people’s streams that they use [for] their normal livelihood have been completely destroyed,” he said. When oil first flowed from the wells in Ogoniland in 1956, before Okpabi was born, it was a lush landscape of mangrove forests. Its sparkling watercourses were populated by fishes, crabs, oysters and other creatures. The land’s people were primarily fishers and farmers. Five and a half decades later, scientists from the UN Environment Programme visited the region to investigate the industry’s effects. They found extensive soil and groundwater contamination, mangrove roots choked with bitumen-like substances, surface water in creeks and streams covered in thick layers of oil. The fish had fled or died and farmers struggled to grow crops in fields soaked with oil. Of all the areas tested, Nisisioken Ogale, Okpabi’s domain, was “of most immediate concern”. People there were drinking from wells contaminated with benzene, a known carcinogen, at levels more than 900 times the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. Follow-up testing carried out in the same area last year found levels that were even higher – 2,600 times the WHO guideline. The effects of this contamination have been tragic, says Okpabi. “There is a lot of cancer: young girls of 20 to 30 years old, 40 years old, developing breast cancer and other forms of cancer; a lot of strange skin diseases that we don’t know the cause of; low life expectancy, people just drying up and dying. Even eye diseases. In some cases birth defects … Strange diseases everywhere in our lives.” The trial centres on claims by Oganiland’s Ogale and Bille communities that the enduring effects of hundreds of leaks and spills from Shell’s pipelines and infrastructure have breached their right to a clean and healthy environment. The three and a half weeks of hearings, which ended on Friday, were a “preliminary issues trial”, heard by Mrs Justice Juliet May, to determine the scope of the legal issues to be decided at the case’s full trial, set for late 2026. Although the case is being heard by a British judge in a UK court, it will apply Nigerian law, and so May heard from a range of senior Nigerian lawyers about what the law is and how it should be applied. The claimants, represented by the London law firm Leigh Day, argue that oil pollution by a private company could be legally construed as a violation of a community’s fundamental rights under the Nigerian constitution and African charter. A second key issue was whether Shell could be held responsible for damage to its pipelines due to oil theft, or for the waste produced as a result of illegal refining of spilled or stolen oil – endemic in the Niger delta. Shell argues it cannot be held responsible. The company insists its Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), works closely with the Nigerian government to prevent spills and to respond to them and clean them up when they do occur. “We strongly believe in the merits of our case. Oil is being stolen on an industrial scale in the Niger delta. This criminality is a major source of pollution and is the cause of the majority of spills in the Bille and Ogale claims,” a spokesperson for the company said. But for Okpabi, the legal technicalities wrangled over in the court have been frustrating, “because as we are sitting here for these three weeks, people are dying at home,” he said. “I’m not a lawyer, but as I sit down in the court and I see all the arguments going on, Shell trying to bring up arguments as if to try to see how they can wheedle their way out [of it], it’s very painful. But I trust the judicial system here.”", "section": "World news", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

The price of eggs made by big names including Cadbury, Mars and Terry’s have risen by as much as 50% in some cases while some have also shrunk in size, according to research by consumer champion Which?. When pack sizes are reduced and prices stay the same, or even go up, it is often dubbed “shrinkflation”. While official figures published on Wednesday showed inflation slowing to 2.8% in February, a breakdown of the headline figure shows food prices rose 3.3%. While price drops for milk, cheese and eggs brought some relief for shoppers, the cost of chocolate raced higher, up by a massive 16.5%. Chocolate has been getting more expensive for several years due to poor harvests in west Africa, in particular Ghana and Ivory Coast, where more than half of the world’s cocoa beans are harvested. While confectionery firms say they have swallowed some of the cocoa price hit, the magnitude of the increase has resulted in higher prices on supermarket shelves. Looking at the weight of the eggs on sale, Which? found that the cost of some Easter eggs had increased by more than 50% a 100g compared with last year. At Lidl an 80g pouch of Terry’s Chocolate Orange mini eggs was 99p in the run-up to Easter in 2024. However in 2025, it was not only more expensive, at £1.35, it had also shrunk to 70g. This equates to a rise of 56% per 100g. The bags on sale in other supermarkets had also shrunk but the price rise per 100g was less – 51% at Asda, 37% at Sainsbury’s and 14% at Tesco. At Morrisons, Which? found a Cadbury Creme Egg 5 Pack Mixed Chocolate Box 200g had risen from £2.62 in the run-up to Easter 2024 to £4 this year. This worked out as a 53% price increase per 100g year on year, although the pack had stayed the same size. At Tesco, Which? found a Twix white chocolate Easter egg had increased from £5 to £6 in the run-up to Easter year on year, and had also shrunk from 316g to 258g, meaning the unit price (per 100g) had gone up by 47%. At Morrisons, Nestlé’s KitKat Chunky milk chocolate Easter egg stayed at the same price in the run-up to Easter year on year at £1.50 but reduced in size from 129g to 110g, making it 17% more expensive per 100g. With shoppers getting less bang for their buck, Reena Sewraz, the senior money and shopping editor at Which?, said: “If you don’t want to pay more for less, it is worth shopping around,” and to be sure to compare the price per gram. Amber Sawyer, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said that for many commodities rising food inflation “bears the fingerprints of climate change”. “Chocolate price inflation is up from 14.1% last month to 16.5% this month. West Africa has been pummelled by climate impacts since 2023, with prices surging 400% last year,” she said. Mars Wrigley said that, due to rising manufacturing costs, it had adjusted some of its product sizes to minimise changes to its list price. Nestlé said significant increases in the cost of cocoa had made it much more expensive to manufacture its products and it has “sometimes been necessary to make adjustments to the price or weight of some of our products”.", "section": "Money", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

Retailers’ fuel price margins are far above historic levels, according to a study by the competition regulator, sparking claims that motorists are being ripped off. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its findings are “deeply concerning”. Margins show the difference between what retailers pay for fuel and the price they sell it for. The CMA’s monitoring found supermarkets’ fuel margins ranged from 8.0-9.1% in the three months to the end of June, while for other retailers it ranged from 9.9-10.6%. Luke Bosdet, the AA’s spokesperson on pump prices, said: “UK consumers faced by inflationary pressures on all fronts and trying to stretch their budgets as far as they can will be incensed by this confirmation of what they suspected – they continue to be ripped off at the pumps. Donald Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs from next week on branded drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinets has raised fresh concerns for the UK pharmaceutical industry, which remains excluded from Keir Starmer’s US tariff deal agreed five months ago. Trump promised the UK “preferential treatment” on pharma tariffs in May but has yet to deliver on his pledge. A British government spokesperson said: “We know this will be concerning for industry, which is why we’ve been actively engaging with the US and will continue to do so over the coming days. “Sectors such as pharmaceuticals are critical to our economy … so we will continue to press the US for outcomes that reflect the strength of our relationship and deliver real benefits for UK industry.” Shares in European truckmakers have fallen today – with Daimler Truck down 2.1% in late trading and Traton Group losing 2.2%. European markets are ending the day in the green, though, with the UK’s FTSE 100 index up 63 points or 0.7% at 9277 points. Over in New York, the US stock market is also unruffled by Donald Trump’s overnight tariff flurry. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 129 points, or 0.3%, at 46,077, with the broader S&amp;P 500 index up 0.13%. Tech stocks seem to be out of favour, again, with the Nasdaq index down 0.1%. We have confirmation that US consumer sentiment has cooled this month. The University of Michigan’s consumer morale index paints a more negative picture than today’s personal spending data. Their index of Consumer Sentiment has dipped to 55.1 points this month, down from 58.2 in August. The survey found that Americans are frustrated with high prices, and more pessimistic about labor markets, business conditions and personal expectations. Those who hold large stakes in the stock market are more positive, though. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu says: ﻿Consumer sentiment confirmed its early-month reading and eased about 5% from last month but remains above the low readings seen in April and May of this year. Although September’s decline was relatively modest, it was still seen across a broad swath of the population, across groups by age, income, and education, and all five index components. A key exception: sentiment for consumers with larger stock holdings held steady in September, while for those with smaller or no holdings, sentiment decreased. This month, sentiment moved down about 9% for independents and 4% for Republicans, whereas it lifted this month for Democrats. Personal spending in the US rose 0.6% last month for the third month in a row, new government data shows, as Americans shrugged off concerns over tariffs, inflation, and a slowing jobs market. This could ease fears that the US economy is on the cusp of a sharp slowdown. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist, says: The rise in real consumption in August means that, given the stronger momentum going into the third quarter, we now have third-quarter consumption growth tracking as high as 3.3%, up from 2.3% last week. Third-quarter GDP growth will be as high as 4%. Over in the US, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure has risen in line with foreasts. The PCE price index increased 0.3% in August, in line with forecasts. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.2% in the month, again as expected. That could cool some concerns that the Trump trade war is fuelling a surge in consumer prices. The CMA has also reported that the cost of fuel across the UK increased from the end of May to the end of August 2025. The average cost of petrol rose to 133.9 pence per litre (ppl) and the average cost of diesel rose to 141.9ppl, representing increases of 1.9ppl and 3.5ppl respectively, they say. The CMA adds: These changes reflect, in part, changing oil prices and refining spreads, both of which are driven by global factors. UK motorists are being ‘ripped off’ at the pumps, the AA warns. Responding to this morning’s government data showing a rise in petrol retailers’ margins, Luke Bosdet, the AA’s spokesman on pump prices, says: “UK consumers faced by inflationary pressures on all fronts and trying to stretch their budgets as far as they can will be incensed by this confirmation of what they suspected – they continue to be ripped off at the pumps. The most blatantly obvious sign of this is the postcode lottery of pump prices between neighbouring towns. This is where price-matching between local rivals often, in effect, gives them permission to charge significantly more than in a town down the road. That means that, if a competitive retailer in one town pulls the local average 2p below the UK average while the average in a neighbouring town is allowed to go 2p above, drivers in the rip-off town lose out by 4p a litre or more than £2 a tank. Sadly, there are more rip-off towns than there are competitive ones. AA analysis of initial use of price searches on its app shows a big demand for this information from the CMA voluntary price scheme. The fuel trade needs to mend it ways or drivers will do it for them when the Government’s mandatory Fuel Finder scheme goes live early next year.” UK fuel retailers are hitting British motorists with historically high profit margins, new data shows. The fuel margins raked in by supermarkets, and other fuel retailers, rose in the last three months, the Competitions and Markets Authority reported this morning shows. The CMA says fuel margins remain “far” above historic levels. Its data shows that supermarket fuel margins stood at 4% in 2017, but more than doubled to an average of 8.4% in the first half of 2025. Non-supermarket fuel margins were 6.4% in 2017, but the first half of this year averaged 9.8%. The CMA says the increase in fuel margins is “deeply concerning” is that fuel margins – a key indicator of retailer profit – remain far above historic levels. Dan Turnbull, senior director of markets at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), says: Our new report shows that drivers across the UK have been paying more at the pump in recent months. While recent price rises are partly explained by an increase in the price of oil, what’s deeply concerning is that fuel margins – a key indicator of retailer profit – remain far above historic levels. The Fuel Finder scheme we recommended to government will help combat this trend, pushing retailers to be more competitive as drivers are empowered with real-time pricing data – making shopping around easier than ever. Government aims to launch the scheme by the end of the year. The UK government says it is pressing the United States on pharmaceutical tariffs in hope of a beneficial outcome, after President Donald Trump said a new 100% tariff would apply to firms unless they build a manufacturing presence in the country. A British government spokesperson says (via Reuters): “We know this will be concerning for industry, which is why we’ve been actively engaging with the U.S. and will continue to do so over the coming days,” “Sectors such as pharmaceuticals are critical to our economy... so we will continue to press the U.S. for outcomes that reflect the strength of our relationship and deliver real benefits for UK industry.” Donald Trump’s overnight threat to impose 100% tariffs on pharmaceuticals from companies not based in the US has been met with fresh uncertainty across Europe. The Germans and the EU-wide trade body have expressed concern while Ireland and Brussels says it remains confident that the 15% tariff rate agreed in July will apply to European drugs exported to the US. The threat also brings fresh threats to exports from the UK, which is still waiting to seal a deal delivering Trump’s pledge to give it “preferential treatment” promised as far back as 8 May, could be snared by any new tariffs. The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations said “urgent discussions” were needed to clarify Trump’s intentions reiterating its position that tariffs on medicines could “increase costs, disrupt supply chains and prevent patients from getting life saving treatments”. Nathalie Moll, Director General, EFPIA said: “The EU and US already have a trade agreement in place; urgent discussions are needed on how to avoid any tariffs on medicines that harm patients in the EU and the US.” Germany’s VFA trade association said on Friday the US deal could hit Germany-based pharmaceutical businesses hard and would violate previous transatlantic trade agreements. Around 25% of Germany pharma exports go to the US, worth about €27bn in 2024, it added. Ireland and Germany are two of the three EU countries with surplus trading relationships with the US and both large pharma industries. Ireland’s deputy prime minister Simon Harris said it would be “studying the impact” of the announcement but stressed that the joint statement on 21 August about the EU US tariff deal “made absolutely clear that any new tariffs announced by the US on pharmaceuticals under its Section 232 investigation would be capped at 15% for pharma products being exported by the EU.” EU trade spokesperson Olof Gill confirmed this was also the view in Brussels: “ This clear all-inclusive 15% tariff ceiling for EU exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators”. The new tariff threat comes just days after the US also opened a section 232 investigation into medical devices that can include anything from stents for the heart to prosthetic hips, X-ray machines and pacemakers. Ireland’s trade minister has insisted that the agreement that US tariffs on EU pharmaceuticals would be capped at 15% remains the case, after Donald Trump’s announcement of higher tariffs on the sector. Simon Harris said in a statement: “I want to stress that the EU and US joint statement issued on August 21 made absolutely clear that any new tariffs announced by the US on pharmaceuticals would be capped at 15% for pharma products being exported by the EU.” “This remains the case and underlines again the value of the agreement reached last month,” he said, adding that Dublin and other EU member states would study the impact of Trump’s announcement. Eurpopean stock markets are largely shrugging off the impact of Donald Trump’s latest tariffs, although truck makers have been jolted. The main European indices are all ending the week with gains. London’s FTSE 100 index is up 0.4% or 37 points at 9250, with Germany’s DAX up 0.5% and France’s CAC share index rising 0.8%. Neil Wilson, UK investor strategist at Saxo, says stocks are shrugging off the noise around tariffs, telling clients: The tariff news ought to add to the bearish narrative we’ve seen take hold in equity markets this week, but so far European equity markets are rising and US futures are a bit higher. Maybe [due to] weaker euro/sterling, maybe just tariff noise can be ignored? Truck manufacturers, though, are suffering from the prospect of a 25% tariff on their goods. Daimler Truck are now down 2.4%, while Munich-based Traton Group have lost 2.8%. European pharmaceuticals stocks have shrugged off their earlier weakness. There seem to be two reasons. The EU-US trade deal caps pharma tariffs at 15%, so they should avoid the new 100% tariff announced last night Companies who have begun building manufacturing in the US are exempt from the new tariffs – and there’s already been plenty of investment recently from, for example, Roche and AstraZeneca as mentioned earlier. Switzerland’s Roche has pointed out that one of its US units recently broke ground on a new facility. A Roche spokesperson has told Reuters that its Genentech unit announced plans for a facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina, on 25 August. Roche has also made a $50bn pledge to invest in U.S. manufacturing and research and development. This could indicate that Roche will be protected from the new pharmaceuticals tariffs, as they won’t apply to companies building U.S. plants. Shares in Roche are up 0.2%. Switzerland says its government departments are analysing the potential impact of pharmaceutical tariff measures announced by US president Donald Trump overnight. The Swiss economy ministry said in a statement that the relevant departments are analysing the impact of the measures together with the relevant stakeholders. It noted that it did not have details of the measures announced (not an ususual situation when it comes to Trump’s trade war pronouncements…) AstraZeneca has quickly shrugged off those early losses. Its shares are only down 0.09% now. Perhaps traders have clocked that its US expansion plans mean it could avoid Trump’s new pharma tariffs…. Shares in some European truckmakers have fallen in early trading, after Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on imports of all heavy-duty trucks. Daimler Trucks, the major commercial vehicle manufacturer, has dropped by around 4%. The Traton Group, whose brands include Scania, MAN, International, and Volkswagen Truck &amp; Bus, are down 2.1%. Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, says Mexico could be most affected by the new tariffs: The US sources 78% of heavy truck imports from Mexico and 15% from Canada, so a key question is whether there will be exemptions for USMCA-compliant products. This is unclear at present, but it’s worth noting that most product-specific tariffs (with the exception of auto parts) have not had USMCA exemptions. If there’s no USMCA exemption, then Mexico will be most heavily affected by the large truck tariffs. Shares in UK pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca have dropped by 1.4% at the start of trading in London. AstraZeneca are the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 share index. That’s a slight surprise (to me, anyway), as AstraZeneca recently announced it will invest $50bn (£37bn) in the US by 2030. That ought to satisfy Trump’s position that taxes could be avoided by companies if they built manufacturing plants in America. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, explains: UK Pharma giant AstraZeneca could be better placed than some of its European rivals, due to promised extra investment in the US that has already been announced, and the President’s promise to treat the UK differently when it comes to pharma tariffs. Thus, the FTSE 100 could be a relative ‘safe haven’ in the middle of this latest tariff storm. Shares in fellow pharma firm GSK are close behind, -0.9%. The overall FTSE 100 is flat in early trading. As tariffs are paid by importers, not exporters, Trump’s new levies could sharply push up the cost of some medicines for Americans. Pascal Chan, vice-president for strategic policy and supply chains at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warned that the tariffs could harm Americans’ health with “immediate price hikes, strained insurance systems, hospital shortages, and the real risk of patients rationing or foregoing essential medicines”. “We are already being crushed by the highest prescription drug costs in the world and this will cause them to skyrocket further,” 314 Action, a US advocacy group that tries to elect scientists to office, said in a statement. “If [Trump] goes through with these tariffs, people across the country will die.” More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Donald Trump has opened up a new front in his global trade wars, jolting investors. Overnight, the US president announced tariffs of 100% on medicines and pharmaceutical goods imported into the US, dropping a shoe that had been dangling over the pharma industry for months. In a wide-ranging move, Trump also announced 25% tariff on imports of all heavy-duty trucks, 50% tariffs on kitchen cabinets, a 50% tariff on bathroom vanities and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, with all the new duties taking effect from 1 October. The tariffs announced by Trump do not apply to generic pharmaceuticals, and companies will be exempt if they have begun constructing new manufacturing facilities in the US. Trump claimed the taxes on imported kitchen cabinets and sofas were needed “for National Security and other reasons”. He said the new heavy-duty truck tariffs were to protect manufacturers from “unfair outside competition” and said the move would benefit companies such as Paccar-owned Peterbilt and Kenworth and Daimler Truck-owned Freightliner. He added: “We need our Truckers to be financially healthy and strong, for many reasons, but above all else, for National Security purposes!”. The announcement has given investors “a fresh reminder about the trade war, and the impact has already been evident in Asian markets,” reports Jim Reid, market strategist at Deutsche Bank. Shares in Asia-Pacific companies with exposure to the US market have dropped today - Japan’s Sumitomo Pharma are down 4.6%, and Austalia’s biotechnology firm CSL have lost almost 2%. Shares in Europe’s biggest pharma companies are also set to fall when trading begins; Novo Nordisk, Roche, Novartis and Astrazeneca are down betweeen 1.8% and 2% on the Tradegate platform, Reuters reports. That’s despite the EU agreeing a trade deal with the US which appears to limit tariffs on pharma and semiconductor exports to 15%, in line with most other sectors in the trade deal. The crackdown on kitchen cabinets has hit stocks too; an index tracking Chinese-listed furniture makers has dropped around 1%. New US inflation data, due this afternoon, will show whether the trade war is pushing up the cost of living for Americans.

It was the first such ruling against a company in the world. Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, welcomed the appeal decision, saying it was “the right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company”. The case was brought by Milieudefensie, the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth, and more than 17,000 co-plaintiffs. “This hurts,” said the director of Milieudefensie, Donald Pols. “At the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further fuelled the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change. That is why we will continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.” Shell was originally told it must slash emissions within its own operations, as well as those of its suppliers and buyers, in line with the Paris climate agreement. During its appeal, Shell argued in court that corporate emissions were a matter for politicians, not the judiciary, and that any fossil fuels it chose not to extract would simply be exploited by another company. The appeals court said Milieudefensie had the right to bring such a claim even though political choices must be made to combat dangerous climate change. But it was not convinced that a reduction obligation imposed on a specific company would have the effect of limiting emissions from its customers, “especially if this reduction obligation can also be realised by selling less fossil fuels”. Milieudefensie had accused Shell of failing to comply with the initial court ruling, which explicitly said the company should begin to act on the judgment immediately regardless of any appeal. The NGO gave evidence to the court that, despite increasing its volume of renewables, Shell was also planning to develop hundreds of new oil and gas fields despite the International Energy Agency warning against investments in any new fossil fuel extraction. The court said it was “reasonable to expect oil and gas companies to take into account the negative consequences of a further expansion of the supply of fossil fuels for the energy transition also when investing in the production of fossil fuels. Shell’s planned investments in new oil and gas fields may be at odds with this.” However, it said this was not relevant to whether a specific reduction obligation should be imposed on the company. Sawan said Shell still planned to halve emissions from its operations by 2030, adding: “We are making good progress in our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions.” The court did uphold the statement that companies such as Shell had obligations to protect human rights. The judgment can still be appealed against and taken to the supreme court. However, this would focus on interpretation of the law and not the key facts of the case. Sjoukje van Oosterhout, head of research at Milieudefensie, said the NGO would read the full ruling carefully before deciding whether to appeal. But she said she believes there is still room for future legal action against corporations. While this appeal was taking place, other domestic courts issued important rulings on assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel projects. In January 2024, Norway blocked the development of three North Sea oil and gas fields on the grounds that the state did not properly assess the impact of future use on climate breakdown. The UK supreme court issued a similar ruling several months later.", "section": "Environment", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

Beattie was familiar with pāua, the Māori word for abalone, and their iridescent shells of shimmering purples and greens. But the pearl that had formed inside was unlike anything he had ever seen, gleaming with layers of the pāua’s natural colours. “I just thought ‘heck, that would make amazing jewellery,’” Beattie says. That was in the early 1990s, and Beattie soon started experimenting ways of farming pāua, and creating pearls in the shell. A decade later, he began selling the so-called blue pearls commercially. Now, a small industry exists in New Zealand cultivating the unique gems. They are rare, with only a handful of companies running farms, each producing only a few thousand pāua pearls each year. But the delicate operations are being made more complicated as changing conditions and warming seas alter the environments pāua need to survive. “Warm waters cause physiological stress to the pāua,” says Shawn Gerrity, an ecologist at the University of Canterbury who has studied the pāua. There are four species of pāua endemic to New Zealand. The blackfoot pāua is the biggest species, known for its vibrant shell and succulent flesh. All cultivated pāua pearls come from the blackfoot pāua. The pearls appear shades of blue, turquoise, purple and green. “Only this abalone, in this water, produces such an unusual colour of pearl,” says Jacek Pawlowski, a jeweller in Akaroa, a seaside town southeast of Christchurch on New Zealand’s South Island. He has worked with the pearls for the last 25 years. “They have that rainbow, opal shine, no pearl is exactly the same,” Pawlowski says. Risk of warming seas Many of the world’s pearls come from freshwater mussels in China, while more valuable Akoya pearls primarily come from Japan. Black and golden “South Sea” pearls are cultivated in Australia and around the Pacific. In New Zealand, making farmed pāua pearls is delicate and labour-intensive. As juveniles, pāua are taken out of the water, where their flesh is pried up and a small implant placed under their shell for a pearl to form on. If their soft bodies are nicked, the pāua will bleed to death, so the process must be gentle. Only one in five pāua will create a jewellery-grade gem, Beattie says. Each mollusc needs to be fed vast quantities of kelp and live in water about 16 degrees for the three to four years it takes for a pearl to form. To keep the pāua cool, Beattie’s farm is towards the mouth of Akaroa Harbour, with colder water from the open ocean. Arapawa Pearls, in the Marlborough Sounds at the top of the South Island, keeps its pāua in tanks to create a constant temperature. But rising ocean temperatures pose a threat to their survival. Sea surface temperatures around New Zealand have increased 0.16 to 0.26C per decade since 1982, according to official statistics. Marine heatwaves have dramatically increased in frequency around New Zealand, with a particularly severe event in 2017/18 causing thousands of sea creatures to die. Increased marine temperatures have caused mass die-offs of abalone species in other areas of the world, like California, where warming water has reduced abalone’s access to food and sped up the transmission of a withering disease. Beattie has had an algal bloom – which is more likely in warm water – kill a harvest of pāua by depriving them of oxygen. Gerrity says marine heatwaves “destroy habitats”. “When kelp is degraded, sea urchins survive, and it’s hard to get pāua back,” he says. Gerrity has researched the recovery of pāua in Kaikōura, on the north-east coast of the South Island, where thousands of pāua died after the sea floor was lifted six metres in a 2016 earthquake. Nine years later, with careful management, the population is healthy again. It is a model for what could happen if a heatwave caused similar pāua deaths, but there’s still a lot of risk. Dr Norman Ragg, senior shellfish scientist at science organisation Cawthron Institute, says pāua are a “really interesting quirk of nature”, that have remained unchanged for millennia. While New Zealand’s populations are still healthy, there is no room for complacency. “There are a lot of bad news stories about abalone around the world – they are a large, tasty, shallow-water, easy-to-catch sea snail that breeds and grows slowly and that puts a lot of burden of responsibility back on to [New Zealand].” Ragg believes cultivating blue pearls could go some way to bolstering appreciation for pāua and securing its future in the face of climate change. Looking over his Akaroa shellfish farm, Beattie says he will continue to “work with nature” to ensure the pāua and their pearls continue to thrive. “It’s almost impossible to improve on what nature makes. The pāua have to be not just healthy, but happy,” he says.", "section": "World news", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

Take care! – JK Jobs are to go at ITV as budgets are set to be cut at flagship morning shows including Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, Loose Women and This Morning to reinvest in programming areas including high quality dramas and sporting coverage such as the World Cup. The biggest impact will be seen at Lorraine, which will be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes and cut back from being on-air 52 weeks to 30 weeks, and Loose Women which will stay the same length but be cut to 30 weeks. This Morning will remain the same length and frequency, while Good Morning Britain will be extended by 30 minutes, running from 6am to 930am. GMB, Lorraine, Loose Women and This Morning are currently produced in-house by ITV Studios. Under the plans, which come into effect from January, production of GMB will be handled by a dedicated team at ITV News. ITV News is produced by ITN which also holds the contracts to produce the news for Channel 4 and Channel 5. In an email to staff, Laura Wilshaw, editor of ITV News, said that GMB would need to be produced on a “reduced overall budget”, adding that the intention is to continue to “faithfully recreate the Good Morning Britain programme viewers love as much as we can”. More than a dozen jobs are expected to go because certain back office roles are duplicated at GMB and ITN-produced ITV News. ITV Studios will continue to produce Lorraine, Loose Women and This Morning but is consulting on a plan to reduce the three separate teams to one. ITV would not say how many roles are are at risk by reducing the production teams for the shows. A spokesperson for ITV said that the move was not related to the performance of any of its shows, but about centralising its national newsgathering production in one place and investing in shows like Mr Bates vs The Post Office and events like the football World Cup. Kevin Lygo, managing director of ITV’s media and entertainment division, said: I recognise that our plans will have an impact on staff off screen in our Daytime production teams, and we will work with ITV Studios and ITN as they manage these changes to produce the shows differently from next year, and support them through this transition. Daytime has been a core element of ITV’s schedule for over 40 years and these changes will set ITV up to continue to bring viewers award winning news, views and discussion as we enter our eighth decade. Elon Musk said that he was committed to being Tesla’s chief executive in five years’ time, speaking at an economic forum in Qatar via video link. Tesla has already “turned around”, Musk said, adding that the weakest market is in Europe while demand is strong everywhere else. The billionaire said that his internet service Starlink might go public at some point in the future, adding there was no rush. The boss of HSBC’s UK arm has said the bank is “being attacked all the time” by cyber criminals, with cyber security now the “biggest expense in business costing lenders hundreds of millions of pounds. Ian Stuart tried to reassure MPs that cyber security was “very much at the top of our agenda,” amid growing concerns that other critical business could end up falling victim to the kind of attacks that caused disruption at Marks &amp; Spencer and the Co-op. M&amp;S has been struggling for almost a month since its IT systems were targetted over the Easter weekend, with the attack having hit its online operations and left some store shelves empty. Stuart told the Treasury Committee today: It does worry me … we are being attacked all the time, so the defence mechanisms that you put in are absolutely critical. That involves “investing hundreds of millions of pounds…this is our biggest expense in business.” He added: The amount of money banks, all of us, will be spending on our systems is enormous today – and it has to be. It has to be because our customers rely on digital technology all the time. The need to keep a bank’s systems operating seamlessly - 24 hours a day, seven days a week – has increased since bosses started accelerating the pace of branch closures and pushing more customers into digital apps and online banking. Stuart said that, at a group level, HSBC alone was processing 1,000 payments a second. Meanwhile, the bank was making around 8,000 changes to its IT systems every week. The HSBC UK boss said no bank would be able to guarantee that its services could stay online 100% of the time. “So the skill is, how quickly can you recover?” Wall Street has opened slightly lower. The Nasdaq fell by 0.4% at the opening bell while the Dow Jones was flat and the S&amp;P 500 slipped by 0.3%. Germany’s BioNTech, which developed the world’s first approved Covid-19 vaccine with backing from US firm Pfizer in the first year of the pandemic, is to invest £1bn in the UK over the next decade, creating two new research centres and a London headquarters. The investment is supported by a government grant of up to £129m, one of the largest grants ever awarded to a pharmaceutical firm, the company said. BioNTech added that it would accelerate clinical trials of personalised mRNA immunotherapies, with a focus on cancer medications. BioNTech, led by chief executive Prof Uğur Şahin, intends to create two new research &amp; development centres, the first of which will be based in Cambridge. It will be home to more than 90 scientists, including the company’s existing researchers working in the UK. The Cambridge labs will focus on genomics, oncology, structural biology, and regenerative medicine. The firm will establish its UK headquarters in London, which will bring together its existing London-based teams and create new jobs in global and regional supporting roles iover the next 10 years. BioNTech’s London office will also host its artificial intelligence hub led by its subsidiary InstaDeep. The drug developer hopes to bring several cancer treatments to the market by 2030. So far, several hundred patients have received potential mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies in the UK by taking part in BioNTech’s global clinical trials. BioNTech shot to prominence in late 2020 with its Covid jab, developed by a “dream team” scientist couple, Şahin and Özlem Türeci, the company’s chief medical officer. Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: This investment is a testament to the fantastic skills, research capabilities, and scientific infrastructure we have in the UK. It is also a template for how the UK could unlock further life science sector growth by removing the barriers and roadblocks to investment. Big investments like this are years in the making and require both sides to have confidence that the other will deliver on their commitments. Trust is slow to build, but this deal shows it is worth the time and the risk. Life science companies are already the largest investors in UK R&amp;D – but much of this comes from a handful of companies with deep UK roots. The UK has an opportunity to capture more of the global science pie if we can improve our competitive offering to the sector. One of BT’s biggest unions has rejected a “derisory” pay offer that it says would result in almost 30% of its members receiving no rise at all. Prospect, one of the largest unions representing BT workers, said that 96% of those who voted rejected the offer. The union, which said the turnout for the vote represented 68% of its BT members, said the telecoms giant’s pay offer worked out at just a 1.28% rise six out of ten managers. Under the offer 28% of BT managers would not receive any pay rise, while the current rate of inflation stands at 2.6%. Rachel Curley, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said: This overwhelming rejection of what is a derisory and insulting pay offer shows the strength of feeling among our members. We have notified the employer of our rejection. It is now time for BT to negotiate a fair award for Prospect members and show more respect for their managers. Prospect has previously accused BT of targeting older, long-serving staff in its drive to cut jobs. Rachel Reeves has backtracked on plans to reduce the tax-free ISA savings allowance, as she bowed to growing pressure from the City. The chancellor has confirmed that she will not change the £20,000 annual limit on popular cash ISAs, a move that will benefit millions of savers. The boss of Shell has once again played down media reports that the oil major is considering a takeover of its beleaguered rival BP. Wael Sawan faced shareholders on Tuesday at the company’s annual general meeting where a shareholder questioned the chief executive on the prospects of a Shell-BP takeover. He said the bar for acquisitions was very high, which was especially true given that Shell’s current share price made it very attractive for the company to continue with its buyback programme. Sawan was spared from facing trickier questions from protesters who were forced to gather outside the company’s central HQ after Shell decided to hold its AGM in a Heathrow hotel protected by a court injunction against environmental protesters. Activists from Amnesty International UK, Fossil Free London, and the Justice 4 Nigeria poured fake oil onto a giant map of the Niger Delta, representing the impact of Shell’s activities in the area, while wearing T-shirts reading “Decades of Oil Spills”, “Polluted Waters”, and “Devastated Communities”. The UK’s biggest pig meat producer, Cranswick, is to instigate a “fully independent, expert veterinarian review” of its welfare policies and livestock operations across the UK after secretly filmed footage revealed abuse of animals at one of its farms. Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons suspended supplies from Cranswick’s Northmoor farm in Lincolnshire after campaigners released footage of workers grabbing piglets by their hind legs and smashing them on to the hard floor – a banned method of killing known as blunt force trauma or “piglet thumping”. The campaigners had also recorded evidence of a sow being kicked and beaten with metal bars, as well as a botched killing that left an animal writhing in agony. Cranswick suspended operations at the farm immediately but said today that it was now carrying out a wider review of its operations which include 400 pig farms as well as poultry facilities. It said: We have always placed the highest importance on animal health and wellbeing and continuously aim to have the most stringent standards in the sector. We take seriously any instance, anywhere in our supply chain, where behaviour fails to meet those standards. The company said it had yet to appoint the reviewers but they would be fully independent. The statement was released alongside full year financial results for Cranswick which revealed the group increased sales by almost 5% to £2.7bn while pre-tax profits rose almost 15% to £181.6m. The number of construction projects started in the UK rose by a third in the past three months, despite a lack of major schemes. Project starts increased by 33% in the three months to April compared with the previous quarter, according to construction data firm Glenigan. The number of projects receiving detailed planing consent rose sharply again, by 52% year on year and 51% higher than in the previous three months, because of the approval of the Lower Thames Crossing. Glenigan’s economic director, Allan Wilen, said: The results are superficially impressive, but a closer look reveals a sector still struggling to reestablish its foothold. It’s hardly surprising. UK construction is continuing to adjust to mercurial market conditions, sometimes having to respond in the moment to the constantly shifting international and domestic economic landscape. Particularly, higher operational costs, likely to keep rising in the near future, mean clients are delaying investment decisions. Likewise, contractors are lukewarm to putting shovels in the ground right now when funding is not forthcoming. There’s no denying US tariff policy has definitely exacerbated the uncertainty. However, steps to de-escalate trade tensions may go some way to improving the current situation, with steps like the US-UK tariff deal going some way to improving confidence over the coming months. Furthermore, the government clearly setting out its strategic store will also help to boost momentum as more promised public works are greenlit. Fewer companies went out of business in England and Wales last month than a year earlier, according to official figures. The Insolvency Service said 2,053 companies were declared insolvent in April, 5% lower than in April last year, but 3% higher than in March 2025. Company insolvencies over the past 12 months have been slightly lower than in 2023, when the annual number hit a 30-year high, but have remained high compared to historical levels. In April, there were 379 compulsory liquidations – the highest monthly number since September 2014 – 1,544 creditors’ voluntary liquidations (CVLs), 105 administrations, 24 company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and one receivership appointment. The number of CVLs was similar to both March and the 2024 monthly average. Administrations were lower than in March, while CVAs were higher. One in 190 companies on the Companies House register entered insolvency between 1 May 2024 and 30 April 2025, a rate of 52.5 per 10,000 companies. This was down from the 57.0 per 10,000 companies that entered insolvency in the 12 months ending 30 April 2024. While the insolvency rate has increased since the lows seen in 2020 and 2021, it remains much lower than the peak of 113.1 per 10,000 companies seen during the 2008-09 financial crisis and recession. This is because the number of companies on the effective register has more than doubled over this period. Jo Hewitt, a senior managing director in the corporate finance &amp; restructuring segment at FTI Consulting, said: The number of compulsory liquidations was 24% higher than March 2025, and remained significantly higher than the 2024 monthly average, suggesting that the climate remains challenging for businesses. Whilst corporate insolvency rates showed a slight increase of 3% compared to March 2025, it is too early to tell if businesses in England and Wales will be resilient to the recent market volatility and tariff uncertainty as the full impact on companies and their supply chains will take a while to play out. Although this month’s interest rate cut may provide a welcome reprieve for over leveraged borrowers, we anticipate that external headwinds, such the rise in employer’s National Insurance Contributions and falling oil prices, together with the continued geopolitical uncertainty will drive financial distress in certain sectors over the coming months. European stock markets are pushing cautiously higher, following modest gains in Asia. The UK’s FTSE 100 index has advanced 45 points to 8,745, a 0.5% gain, while Germany’s Dax is 0.25% ahead, France’s CAC edged up 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MiB added nearly 0.5%. Oil prices have fallen slightly, with Brent crude down by 0.26% to $65.37 a barrel. In currency markets, sterling has gained 0.1% to $1.3373 against the dollar. The dollar is generally on the backfoot amid ongoing concerns over the US economy, and has lost 0.2% against a basket of major currencies. JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned last night that investors were being too complacent as markets shook off news that the US has lost its last triple-A credit rating amid fresh concern over the federal government’s burgeoning debt pile. Credit ratings agency Moody’s dealt a blow to Washington on Friday when it stripped the US of its top-notch rating, downgrading the world’s largest economy by one notch to AA1 and become becoming the last of the big three agencies to drop its triple-A rating for the US. The announcement unnerved markets on Monday morning, but stock markets had recovered by the end of the day. Speaking at JP Morgan’s annual investor day meeting in New York, Dimon warned against complacency. “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks. You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think [they can],” he said. Dimon said he saw an “extraordinary amount of complacency” and added that he believes the possibility of stagflation – a recession with rising prices – was far higher than investors believe. Moody’s downgrade came as Donald Trump struggles to push his “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill through Congress, Moody’s said it expected the US budget deficit to keep rising. More on Australia’s interest rate cut, the second reduction this year – partly designed to protect indebted households from Trump’s tariffs, which have spooked consumers and businesses, and created the potential for a protracted trade war. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s governor, Michele Bullock, said inflation was coming down, and the jobs market was robust, but characterised the global backdrop as a “complete rollercoaster”. Hundreds of former post office operators will be compensated by the Post Office after it accidentally leaked their names and addresses last June. The Post Office has confirmed that individual payouts will be capped at £5,000, although higher claims may still be pursued. It comes almost a year after 555 victims of the Horizon IT scandal had their personal details published on the Post Office’s corporate website. The Post Office said victims would receive £5,000 or £3,500 depending on whether the address published was current. In a statement, it said: We have written to all named individuals either directly, or via their solicitors. If there are any individuals whose name was impacted by last year’s breach, but who have not received information about the payment for some reason, they can contact us or ask their solicitors if they have legal representation. The law firm Freeths said that 348 clients, out of the total 420 it represented, who had their data breached had already received payment. Freeths said it had been told most of those affected would receive a “significant interim compensation payment”. Here’s our full story on Greggs. Sales at Greggs have picked up after the UK’s biggest bakery chain branched out into iced drinks, pizza boxes and a macaroni cheese that has gone viral on social media. The bakery, which is headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, reported a 2.9% rise in comparable sales in the first 20 weeks of the year. New beverages and food on the shelves helped step up sales growth, including a new peach iced tea, mint lemonade, and a mac and cheese that has amassed thousands of views on TikTok. Shares in Greggs rallied in early trading on Tuesday, up by as much as 7%. However, the stock has suffered this year, losing about a quarter of its value since January, amid broader concerns around slowing sales growth. Responding to the protests, a Shell spokesperson said the oil spills in the Niger Delta were being cleaned up. These are important issues and we respect the right of people to express their view. But for many years the vast majority of spills in the Niger Delta have been caused by third parties acting unlawfully, such as oil thieves who drill holes in pipelines, or saboteurs. These challenges are managed by a joint venture which Shell’s former Nigerian subsidiary, SPDC, operated, cleaning up every spill from the joint venture’s facilities. Back to Shell’s annual meeting, and the protests over the Niger Delta outside its headquarters. A Shell spokesperson said: We agree that society urgently needs to take action on climate change. We are reducing our emissions, helping customers reduce theirs, and investing in the low-carbon energy system of the future. In the last two years, this has totalled $8bn in the development of solutions including electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuels, renewable power generation, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Added to previous investments, that’s $20bn in lower carbon options. But as the world continues to use oil and gas to heat homes, deliver goods and transport people, we must also carry on investing in the secure and affordable energy the world needs today. The company has built Holland Hydrogen, slated to be one of Europe’s largest green hydrogen plants; bought Nature Energy, Europe’s biggest biogas producer, for $2bn; and invested in the Northern Lights joint venture in Norway for CO2 transport and storage. However, according to Dutch media, Shell’s €1bn Holland Hydrogen I project has been plagued by financial concerns, shifting regulations, and an uncertain market – and may never open. Shell’s response did not address activists’ concerns over the environmental damage in the Niger Delta. They say oil spills and leaks have devastated the health and livelihoods of many of the 30 million people living in the area. Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said the quarterly pace of interest rate cuts had been “too rapid” given the inflation outlook, but added that the path for interest rates remained “downward”. The central bank lowered interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25% to cushion the UK economy against the impact of rising economic uncertainty. Giving a speech entitled The courage not to act at a briefing hosted by Barclays, he said he thought the pace of rate cuts since mid-2024 had been “too rapid given the balance of risks to price stability we face”. This is in line with his preference for “cautious and gradual” cuts in Bank Rate expressed over the past 12 months, he said. I would therefore characterise my dissenting vote [in May] as favouring a ‘skip’ in the quarterly pattern of Bank Rate cuts intended to slow the pace at which monetary restriction is withdrawn. It should not be seen as favouring a halt to (still less a reversal of) that withdrawal of restriction. I believe that the underlying disinflation process remains intact and – conditional, as always, on the information and analysis available today – that the prospective path of Bank Rate from here is downward. Shell is holding its annual meeting today, and faces protests from activists calling for a full clean-up of the damage caused in the Niger Delta. Activists from Amnesty International UK, Fossil Free London, and the Justice 4 Nigeria coalition are staging a protest outside Shell’s global headquarters in London, just hours before the oil giant holds its AGM at a hotel in Heathrow where protests are barred by a court injunction. The meeting is due to start at 10am. The campaigners say: For nearly 70 years Shell’s oil spills and leaks – arising from poorly maintained pipelines and wells and inadequate clean-up efforts – have devastated the health and livelihoods of many of the 30 million people living in the Niger Delta. The pollution has contaminated water sources, killed fish and crops, destroyed mangrove forests, and caused serious health issues, including respiratory illnesses, increased rates of miscarriage and infant mortality. According to research, babies born to women who lived near oil spills before pregnancy are twice as likely to die in their first month than elsewhere in the country. Despite making billions in profits, Shell has consistently failed to adequately clean up or compensate affected communities. From just one area – Ogoniland – the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People estimates Shell earned $30bn over 30 years, while ruining local lives and livelihoods. Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK’s business and human rights director, added: Despite numerous court rulings ordering Shell to clean up and compensate the people it has harmed, the company continues to drag its feet. Shell has made huge profits at the expense of the Niger Delta’s people without taking any responsibility, it must now be held accountable. For decades communities have demanded justice and the right to live in a safe, healthy environment. Shell has created a living hell in the Niger Delta – now it must clean up and pay up. Dominic Twomey from Amnesty International said on X: Shell has been contacted for comment. More on Britain’s biggest bakery chain Greggs, whose trading has improved in recent weeks. The share price jumped by 7%. John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said: Greggs has been going through a tougher period recently, with the shares down around -30% in the year to date. Recent price increases of around 2% suggest the company is trying to right-size in the aftermath of the National Insurance increases, recalibrating its roll out and growth ambitions. There are tentative signs that Greggs is making progress in today’s update, with sales continuing to rise, the shop portfolio growing, and expectations for the year unchanged. Slowing growth will still be a concern, as well as the wider question about whether we have reached ‘peak Greggs’ in the UK. Nevertheless, the baker is a resilient and innovative business that has proven its ability to bounce back from tricky times. Richard Hunter, head of markets at the trading platform interactive investor, said Vodafone is “beginning to ring the changes”. Shares in the FTSE 100 company rose by less than 1%, despite a €4bn share buyback. Turning around a super tanker is never an easy task, especially when the company is in the midst of a highly competitive arena, but there are some signs that Vodafone is beginning to ring the changes. The group had quite simply been fighting fires on too many fronts while dealing with an increasingly onerous debt burden, leading to the need for a significant transformation. What should now emerge from the turnaround is a smaller and less geographically diverse, but more focused operation… One particular area of promise is the Africa operation, which now accounts for 20% of group income. Service revenue grew by 11.3% over the year, with the group well positioned to benefit further from some potentially explosive growth in the region, particularly given the more widespread availability and use of the services which the industry provides, and of which Vodafone is an established player. Turning to the UK and Germany, he said: The UK business is another region which the group is aiming to strengthen, and its planned mega-merger with Three UK should complete imminently. The merger should truly change the domestic landscape, while also providing new revenue opportunities at scale as well as cost synergy savings of around £700 million per year on completion. In the meantime, the unit accounts for 19% of group income and saw total revenue growth of 1.9% for the period. The most obvious thorn in the group’s size remains the German operation, which is the group’s largest and accounts for 35% of overall service revenue, which declined by 5% for the year. The unit is still suffering from customer losses which were largely attributable to enforced price increases last year, competitive activity elsewhere and the lingering effects of the change to German TV law which resulted in a recontracting of customers, where the previous number of 8.5 million has been reduced to 4.2 million households. More broadly, the telecoms sector is one which is of course based on reliability, but equally importantly on price, where there remains ferocious competition. Recent years have also required huge investment as the industry moves on, such as being part of the new 5G network, with the benefit of any payback not being felt for any number of years. This becomes especially pertinent when margin protection tends to come with sheer volumes as opposed to the ability to raise prices indiscriminately. Rachel Reeves said the UK government is closing in on a trade pact with six Gulf nations, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as its next major deal. The chancellor told the BBC the agreement would be the government’s “next deal” as it looks to boost trade ties following Brexit. Reeves suggested economic growth would be strengthened through recent trade deals with the United States, the EU and India, all inked within a fortnight. Britain is in a better place than any other country in the world in terms of deals with those countries. The first deal and the best deal so far with the US, we’ve got the best deal with the EU for any country outside the EU, and we’ve got the best trade agreement with India. The chancellor also said the UK was “not looking to have trade negotiations with China”. In early April, foreign secretary David Lammy said Labour was continuing discussions with the Gulf over a trade deal, which were started by the previous Conservative government. Reeves’ comments come after a new trade deal with Brussels was struck on Monday. The Prime Minister hailed his deal, set out at a summit in London, as a “win-win” for both parties, which would be the start of a “new era” in the UK-EU relationship. The wide-ranging deal will allow more British travellers to use passport e-gates when going on holiday to Europe, while farmers will get swifter, easier access to trade on the continent as a result of an agreement on animal and plant product standards. A “youth experience scheme” allowing young Britons to study and live in Europe, and a new security and defence partnership were also agreed. But the deal has been met with criticism after the UK agreed to grant European fishing trawlers a further 12 years’ access to British waters. Sir Keir Starmer hailed a “mood change” in the relationship with the bloc, saying: “The EU and the UK wanting to work together, all of us prepared to say let yesterday be yesterday, we are looking forward to tomorrow. We are not going to litigate old arguments, we are going to go forward in the spirit of what we do together, we do better. Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch said, however: This deal will mean Britain becoming a rule-taker, accepting dynamic alignment, giving up fishing rights and paying new money to the EU. Nobody has lost more than the fishermen. Vodafone has fallen into the red after taking a €4.5bn hit from writedowns on its businesses in Germany and Romania, but said it expected to return to top-line growth in Germany, its biggest market. The mobile phone giant made a pre-tax loss of €1.5bn in the year to 31 March, against a profit of €1.6bn the previous year. It took impairment charges of €4.4bn on its struggling German division and €165m on its Romanian business. Revenues rose by 2% to €37.5bn. Chief executive Margherita Della Valle was upbeat, though. We have reshaped Europe, we are seeing the positive impact of our drive for customer satisfaction in all our markets - most noticeably in the UK and Germany - and we have delivered strong operational improvements across the business. Clearly there is much more to do, but this period of transition has repositioned Vodafone for multi-year growth. Looking ahead, we expect to see broad-based momentum across Europe and Africa, and for Germany to return to top-line growth during this year. This is reflected in our guidance for profit and cash flow growth for the year ahead. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. China’s and Australia’s central banks have both cut interest rates to stimulate their economies and cushion the impact of US trade tariffs. China cut its benchmark lending rates for the first time since October, following Beijing’s sweeping monetary easing measures. The People’s Bank of China reduced the one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points to 3.0%, and the five-year loan prime rate was cut by the same amount to 3.5%. The lending rate cut was announced just after five of China‘s biggest state-owned banks trimmed their deposit interest rates. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Bank of China reduced their deposit rates by 5-25bps. Global investment banks have upped their forecasts for China’s economic growth this year, after Beijing and Washington agreed to a 90-day pause on tariffs, despite ongoing uncertainty around the trade negotiations. China’s president Xi Jinping called for continuous efforts to build a stronger manufacturing industry, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Xi stressed the need for the country to be self-reliant and to master key technologies, as he visited a bearings manufacturer in China’s central Henan province. Marco Sun, chief financial market analyst at MUFG Bank, said the rate cuts were aimed at boosting credit lending and stimulating consumption. The central bank is likely to switch to a wait-and-see approach in coming months unless external geopolitical risks deteriorate enough to extinguish hopes that the economy can stabilise. The Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges rose by 0.4% and 0.8%, while the Australian stock market advanced by 0.6% and Japan’s Nikkei was little changed. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its cash rate by 25bps to a two-year low of 3.85% at its May meeting, the first rate cut since January. The Australian dollar fell after the decision was announced. The central bank said: Inflation is in the target band and upside risks appear to have diminished as international developments are expected to weigh on the economy. The board assesses that this move will make monetary policy somewhat less restrictive. It nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook. Britain’s biggest bakery chain Greggs said sales growth picked up in the past five months, as its newly launched Mac and Cheese went viral on TikTok. The company, famous for its sausage rolls and vegan alternatives, said like-for-like sales (at outlets open at least a year) rose by 2.9% in the first 20 weeks of 2025. In the first nine weeks sales had disappointed with a 1.9% rise, its worst performance since the pandemic, for which it blamed bad weather and a tough macroeconomic backdrop. After an initial trial last year, its made-to-order range, including chicken burgers, wraps and fish finger sandwiches is now sold in more than 300 shops across the country. Greggs opened 66 new shops, which means it now has 2,638 outlets, as it aims to launch up to 150 over the year.

Due to a left-spiralling shell, Ned has a vanishingly small chance of finding a mate – a predicament that has sparked a nationwide campaign. Nearly all common garden snails have shells that coil to the right but Ned’s left-spiralling shell is like a mirror image, resulting in a flipped shell and reversed reproductive organs – a configuration that affects roughly 1 in 40,000 snails. Snails with shells and reproductive organs on the opposite side cannot mate with each other, so unless another similarly built snail is found, Ned will be forced to live a life of celibacy. Ned – named after The Simpson’s famous left-handed neighbour Ned Flanders – was discovered last week in a back garden in Wairarapa, an hour north of Wellington. Illustrator and author Giselle Clarkson was digging up vegetables in her garden when a snail dropped into the dirt. She was about to toss it away when she noticed something was a bit off. “Something was different but I couldn’t figure it out – the first thought that went through my mind was that it was a different species,” she tells the Guardian. She soon realised that the snail’s shell coiled on the left. “After you see something thousands and thousands of times looking one way, and then you suddenly see it the other way around, it is quite uncanny.” Clarkson had become familiar with left-spiralling snails through her work at New Zealand Geographic magazine and immediately knew she was dealing with something special. She made Ned a home in a fishbowl and contacted the magazine with her find. They have since launched a national campaign to find Ned a mate. The campaign urges people in New Zealand to rummage around their gardens and parks for left-coiled snails, and asks anyone who is lucky enough to find one to get in touch. Ned may be rare, but his plight is not the first to garner attention. In 2017, an international search was launched to find a mate for Jeremy, another lonely lefty discovered in London. Two eligible left-sided mates were discovered but made headlines when they ended up coupling with each other instead. Jeremy eventually mated with one of the pair and produced offspring with exclusively right-spiralling shells, before dying, aged two. Ned is a common garden snail, an introduced species that is considered a pest in New Zealand’s gardens. Some gardeners may raise their eyebrows at trying to boost their population – even if it is by just a handful – but the campaign has a broader purpose. “We’re all about trying to connect people with the environment,” said Catherine Woulfe, New Zealand Geographic editor. “[It] is light and fun but we hope it’s also a doorway into deeper topics like gardening, understanding the natural world, and the weird intricacies of reproduction,” she said. This month, a study revealed human connection to nature had declined by 60% in 200 years and introducing children to nature, as well as greening urban spaces were some of the best methods to help reverse the decline. “For the last two nights my kids have happily put on their gumboots and head torches and spent half an hour pottering around the garden, snail-hunting in the dark,” Woulfe said. “That feels like a win.”", "section": "World news", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

The design by Khaleb Brooks, an American whose own ancestors were enslaved in Mississippi, was chosen by a judging panel from a shortlist of six. The memorial will sit on a site in West India Quay, one of the key entry points to the UK for commodities, such as sugar, that were produced by enslaved people. The Wake, a seven-metre tall sculpture in the shape of a bronze cowrie shell that includes the names of enslaved people inside and a wind-chime soundscape, is expected to be installed in 2026. Brooks said they hoped it would serve as a place of “rest and refuge”, and that all Londoners would feel free to interact with the artwork, which was announced by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, on Unesco International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. “When we talk about the transatlantic slave trade we’re speaking to people’s history and not just black people’s histories,” said Brooks, who was also an artist-in-residence at the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool. “It’s everyone’s history on this land, no matter what our involvement was.” “We’re still very much impacted by the history of the trade. So I hope The Wake exists and serves as an acknowledgement that there’s still a lot of work to do.” Brooks chose the cowrie shell as the basis for The Wake after learning about the object’s use as currency during trading of enslaved people, such as the abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, who described being sold for 172 cowrie shells in his memoir. Sadiq Khan, whose City Hall provided £500,000 toward the project, called the work a “stark reminder of the pain and suffering caused by transatlantic slavery and the role the UK and London played” in it. The memorial will sit close to the former site of a statue of Robert Milligan, an 18th-century enslaver, taken down in 2020 after protests. “It’s essential that London’s streets, statues and memorials reflect our shared history, and this memorial will help to remind and educate Londoners of the capital’s role in this terrible treatment of human beings,” Khan added. The timing of the unveiling, coming a few weeks after the recent race riots in the UK, gives the announcement added poignancy, according to Debbie Weekes-Bernard, the deputy mayor for communities and social justice. “Given that we’re making this announcement in the wake of what happened over the past couple of weeks, there just needs to be a broader conversation about race and racism in this country generally,” she said. “We need to discuss the longevity and the impact of slavery on the experiences that black communities have now.” The memorial will be the latest addition to the UK’s landscape that addresses its racial history. Artists Veronica Ryan and Thomas J Price created monuments that stand outside Hackney town hall in east London and commemorate the Windrush generation, while there’s a campaign – backed by former Tory cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt – to erect a memorial to the West African Squadron in Portsmouth. The Wake is supported by the mayor’s commission on diversity in the public realm, set up by Sadiq Khan in 2020 after protests triggered by the Black Lives Matter movement. The commission has already funded statues, artworks and walking tours. However, establishing a memorial to remember the victims of the transatlantic slave trade in the capital has proved impossible until now. Memorial 2007, a group of volunteers led by Oku Ekpenyon, has been campaigning and raising money to erect a memorial to the slaves for more than two decades. The Australian artist Les Johnson was commissioned and the group raised nearly £100,000. In 2008, Boris Johnson endorsed their proposal for a £4m bronze statue depicting the history of slavery, saying Hyde Park was “a fitting site for a permanent memorial to the millions who lost their lives”. But successive governments failed to provide funding and despite Memorial 2007 having high-profile backers including the then archbishop of York, John Sentamu; Paul Boateng, the first black cabinet minister in British history; and Doreen Lawrence, the project could not secure the funding needed. The Wake will also feature satellite sites around the capital, where smaller cowrie shells will be installed, and there is a planned educational programme that is yet to be announced.", "section": "UK news", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

Andrew Bailey also told the BCC’s annual conference today that growth in the economy is likely to “moderate” this year, after a pacy start to 2025. His comments came shortly before new data showed America’s economy shrank faster than previously thought in January-March, due to the surge of imports to beat Donald Trump’s trade wars. Prime minister Keir Starmer acknowledged the tax burden placed on businesses during his speech to the BCC this morning, as firms urged the government not to impose further tax rises. In other news… A report into the Office for National Statistics has identified ‘cultural’ failings which led to its problems producing reliable data, and recommending splitting the top job running the ONS. Energy secretary Ed Miliband has declined to support a plan to build the world’s longest subsea power cable to bring North Africa’s renewable energy to British homes and companies. Shell has said it has “no intention” of making an offer for the rival fossil fuel company BP after speculation it had been planning a £60bn takeover, ruling out a formal approach for the next six months. The former Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has lost a legal challenge against the UK financial regulator, leaving him banned from the City for life for misleading the watchdog over his relationship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The dollar has fallen to a three-year low following a report that Donald Trump is considering bringing forward the announcement of his choice to succeed the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. The selloff pushed the pound up by almost a cent to $1.375, its highest level in over three years. The Devereux Review of the Office for National Statistics has found cultural problems that ultimately contributed to the statistical problems that have plagued the organisation. They fall into three areas: a “commendable interest in both new approaches to statistics”, which led the ONS to de-prioritise the crucial task of delivering core economic statistics of sufficient quality to guide decision making A weak system of planning and budgeting, leading to ONS staff not having the resources they needed. A reluctance, at senior levels, to hear and act on difficult news. The ONS aimed to be “radical, ambitious, inclusive, and sustainable” – which it lived up to in the Covid-19 pandemic when other activities were de-prioritised. However, the Review adds, “several people suggested that the list of values was missing “realistic””. The review says there has been: …a reluctance on the part of some to take at face value the warnings which have been raised, apparently preferring instead to categorise those making the warnings as lacking in accountability. This categorisation seems to me to be without foundation, and it has undoubtedly made life difficult for many senior people working at ONS who are concerned about the quality of population and economic statistics. I am not surprised that so many, experienced, senior leaders have chosen to leave. A review into the UK’s troubled statistics body has recommended splitting its top job. The Devereux Review of the Office for National Statistics’s performance and culture has found that there are various “deep-seated” issues at the ONS. Sir Robert Devereux, a retired civil servant, has recommended that these issues would best be addressed by temporarily splitting the role of National Statistician in two. That would create a new role of ONS Permanent Secretary. This new Permanent Secretary position could be handed to someone with a track record of leading, and turning around, an operational business, Devereux says ,adding: I suggest temporary separation since, with the more effort to develop evident talent within the Government Statistical Service, I think it might well be possible to re-combine the roles in due course, once the organisation’s core business is back on a more stable footing. The role of National Statistician is currently unfilled, as Professor Sir Ian Diamond retired with immediate effect, on account of ill health, during the Review. The ONS’s operations have been criticised, after its surveys were hit by falling participation rates among the public, leading to questions about the validity of its data. Today acting National Statistician Emma Rourke says: “We welcome Sir Robert Devereux’s report and fully acknowledge the issues he has highlighted. This represents a turning point for the ONS as we commit to implement the recommendations and reset towards a culture that embraces feedback and challenge. The ONS has also published a new plan for economic statistics, under which it will invest £10m to improve its core economic and population statistics. The ONS has also admitted that improving these statistics will take collective effort, adding: In some cases, this may mean revising published figures or historical series. That is not a sign of failure, but of a statistical system willing to evolve, led by evidence, and open about how it improves. We will work closely with users to ensure revisions and breaks in series are well managed, with support provided to users. Kemi Badenoch then argues that the “fundamental question” facing the UK is whether it is “whether we are for the makers or for the takers”. Badenoch tells the British Chambers of Commerce that this boils down to: Whether we are for those who work hard, who get on, who build businesses, who make things happen, whether it’s a plumber or a nurse, or those who don’t. And I know whose side I’m on. Turning to the government’s political crisis over its welfare reform bill, Badenock says: Our debt interest is well over 100 billion pounds a year. Welfare spending is out of control. The state is bloated. Productivity has flatlined, and the economy is stuck in first gear. Our country is living beyond its means. Calling for “a total different approach”, Badenoch says things need to be made easier for those ‘makers’. Echoing George Osborne’s attack in 2012 on families on benefits who live with “the blinds are down” as neighbours head to work, the Tory leader says: Currently this country has too many people who are taking, whether it is those who sit at home with the curtains drawn while others go out to work, or those who skip the queue and arrive here illegally, only to be given privileged access to social housing, the NHS and our generous welfare system. [On the lattter point, the House of Commons Library explains that “Migrants in the UK on visas, illegally or seeking asylum are usually ineligible for welfare benefits and social housing”.] Our Politics Live blog has all the latest details on the welfare bill row: Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch is now addressing the BCC’s annual conference, and laying into the government’s record. Badenoch tells business leaders that one reason her party lost the election last July is that they were no longer trusted, and also that they got enough things wrong that people wanted change. She then criticises Keir Starmer’s economic record over his first year, saying: After 12 months of Labour in office since July, we’ve had inflation higher, unemployment up, growth halved. I mean this is change, but it is change for the worse. And it didn’t have to happen. [factcheck: At 3.4% last month, inflation is higher than last July, when it was 2.2%. But, it’s still short of the 11.1% hit in October 2022. On growth, Badenoch may be referring to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecast for growth in 2025, which was halved in March to 1.0%. It blamed a “more challenging and uncertain backdrop” for this cut. And the unemployment rate has indeed risen, to 4.6%, the highest since July 2021.] Badenoch blames the goverment’s increase in national insurance, calling it a “jobs tax” that is killing jobs, adding: It is making it impossible for businesses to grow. And then we see that family businesses, which form the backbone of many of our communities, have been hit with increased taxes. A gauge of trade activity is risen in the last quarter, amid the scramble to ship goods before new US tariffs come into effect. The World Trade Organization’s Goods Trade Barometer rose to 103.5, up from 102.8 in the three months to March But the WTO is concerned that there may be a slowdown later this year, saying: “The decline in export orders and the temporary nature of frontloading suggest that trade growth may slow in the months ahead.” Ed Miliband has rejected plans put forward by the former boss of Tesco to build the world’s longest subsea power cable to bring North Africa’s renewable energy to British homes and companies. The energy secretary has ruled out granting Sir Dave Lewis a support contract to guarantee stable payments for the electricity delivered by the Xlinks high-voltage cable project from wind and solar farms in Morocco. Lewis and a string of high profile investors had hoped to bury a 4,000km cable along the seabed to carry up to 8% of Great Britain’s electricity from renewable energy and battery projects in the Tantan province to the Devon coast in under a second. But after five years of lobbying the government for support for the world-first energy project the energy secretary rejected the plans amid concerns over whether the project would deliver value for money, and wider economic benefits for UK supply chain firms. There were also concerns over the geopolitical implications of relying so heavily on energy from a foreign country following four years of upheaval on the Russia-Ukraine border and in the Middle East. Lewis told the Guardian last year that Xlinks - which is backed by French energy company TotalEnergies, the UK’s Octopus Energy, and its founder Greg Jackson - hoped to secure a contract which pays between £70 to £80 per megawatt hour (MWh). This sum would be less than the deal struck with the developers of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, and in line with the expected cost of future offshore wind farms. But after spending around £100m developing the project Lewis and his backers are expected to try to find a new route to market by setting up power purchase agreements - known as PPAs - directly with major energy buyers. Back in the UK, the competition regulator is considering whether Boeing’s deal to acquire Spirit AeroSystems could affect competition. The deal was agreed almost a year ago, with Boeing paying $4.7bn for aerospace supplier Spirit, which makes the body of the 737 Max jet, The CMA is inviting comments from parties by 15 July. It wants to find out if the deal will result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services. America’s jobs market also appears to be slowing! Recurring applications for US unemployment benefits have risen to the highest level since November 2021, a sign that more Americans are staying out of work for longer. The number of ‘continuing claims’ for unemployment support rose to 1,974,000 in the week to 14 June, an increase of 37,000 from the previous week’s revised level. This is the highest level for insured unemployment since 6 November, 2021 when it was 2,041,000. The continuing claims figure is a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, so this indicates a slowdown in the US jobs market. The number of new claims for jobless support dropped last week, though, to 236,000, a decrease of 10,000. Newsflash: The US economy shrank more rapidly than previously estimated in the first quarter of this year, as Donald Trump’s tariff threats widened the US trade gap. The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annualized rate in Q1, more than the 0.2% rate of decline estimated a month ago, the Bureau for Labor Statistics has reported. That’s the equivalent of a 0.125% quarter-on-quarter contraction. The BLS says: The decrease in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and a decrease in government spending. These movements were partly offset by increases in investment and consumer spending. Bailey also warned there is “still some way to go” in the process of bringing wage growth down. Such a reduction is necessary, he argues, to create “a sustainable disinflation” in the UK economy. Governor Bailey says there are signs that pay growth is slowing, explaining: Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) growth was 5.1% in the three months to April, down from 5.9% in the three months to January, having risen in the second half of last year. That said, AWE measures are reducing much as we have been expecting, and momentum in the latest data has softened. The latest data on pay settlements and pay expectations point to a significant decline in wage growth in the year ahead. The latest intelligence from the Bank’s Agents continue to suggest average pay settlements for 2025 of 3.5 to 4.0%, closer to levels consistent with the inflation target. Andrew Bailey also indicated that the increase in employer NICs rates, which began in April, could be pushing up prices in the shops. He tells the BCC’s conference that food price inflation, which rose to 4.4% in May, is also on the Bank’s “watch list”, adding: The prices of meat, chocolate and non-alcoholic drinks have gone up the most, consistent with higher wholesale prices for beef, cocoa beans and coffee. These price increases are to an extent idiosyncratic, with reports of reductions in cattle herds and climate-related disruptions to coffee and cocoa production. But our Agency intelligence also highlights labour costs and costs related to new packaging regulation as wider factors at play. And, like energy prices, food prices are salient to consumers. We have to make sure that these increases do not feed through to second-round effects either. The governor of the Bank of England has warned UK businesses that Britain’s jobs market may be easing. In his speech to the BCC’s annual conference, Andrew Bailey says he is hearing “a bit more evidence” that firms are adjusting pay and employment levels following the rise in employer National Insurance Contributions announced in the last budget. Bailey says: In recent months, the evidence that slack is opening up has strengthened, especially in the labour market. But there remain uncertainties around the overall balance between supply and demand in the economy as well as the remaining inflation persistence in the system. The governor cites the latest labour force statistics, which shows subdued employment growth is subdued, and “several indicators of labour demand and hiring intentions have softened”, including a fall of over 100,000 in the number of payrolled employees in May. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey then warns the British Chambers of Commerce that UK growth is likely to slow to a “more moderate pace” over the coming quarters. Bailey explains that the 0.7% growth in January-March was stronger than expected, but partly due to one-off factors. He says: First, the unexpected strength in the first quarter was driven by strong outcomes for volatile components of GDP in the monthly figures for March. This was possibly a result of front-loading of activity ahead of increases in Stamp Duty Land tax and Vehicle Exercise Duty, and with a temporary boost to trade ahead of the imposition of new tariffs on exports to the United States. Consistent with this, monthly GDP contracted by 0.3% in April. Second, looking at the expenditure components of GDP, while business investment was strong in the first quarter, businesses tell us that heightened uncertainty and a weak demand outlook are weighing on investment intentions. That could point to slower investment over coming months – although how it pans out remains to be seen, and again I was encouraged by what the Prime Minister had to say earlier. And, while real household incomes have risen quite strongly, consumption has not followed suit. The household savings rate, in other words, has gone up – and to quite a high level compared to past experience. We have not seen evidence yet to indicate any decline in the saving rate, with the implications that carries for consumption. The governor of the Bank of England is warning UK businesses that they are at risk from “elevated global uncertainty”. Speaking to the BCC’s annual conference in London today, Andrew Bailey says: There is a lot going on in the world around us. Escalation of the conflict in the Middle East drove up energy prices in the past few weeks but in the last few days they have come back down again. Global trade policies remain unpredictable. These are things that weigh on the global economy. Bailey then warns that the UK economy’s potential growth has slowed in recent decades – from an estimate of over 2.5% in the period from 1990 to the financial crisis, to just 1.25% since. Raising the potential growth rate of the economy is one of the most important challenges facing us as a society today, Bailey insists, saying this is the only way to sustainably lift the standard of living. Bailey also gives Keir Starmer some credit, saying: Growth also requires strong institutions and public policies to provide a supportive environment. I welcome the Government’s strong commitment to growth and its initiatives to strengthen the UK’s relations to our trade partners. The Prime Minister’s messages this morning were very positive and welcome news, setting out a course that can unleash further investments that will make a real difference to the UK economy. Newsflash: Jes Staley, the former CEO of Barclays, has failed to overturn a ban on holding senior management roles in the financial services industry. Staley has lost a legal challenge against the UK regulator, leaving him banned from the City for life for misleading the watchdog over his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Here’s the full story: The British Chambers of Commerce were also reminded about the financial burden which the Starmer governent has put on businesses. BCC director general Shevaun Haviland told today’s conference that she hears “frustration, irritation and exasperation” from companies around the country, as the economy continues to struggle. She added: The reality of British business is hard, it’s relentless, it’s knackering, it’s being endlessly creative, its seven days a week....and it’s absolutely essential for the UK’s future prosperity. So, it’s not been helped by the Treasury demanding that business plug the black hole in its finances. Haviland added that the size and scale of the rise in National Insurance Contributions took businesses by surprise; it has driven down consumer confidence, and contributed to a third of companies either making staff redundant or considering it. While Keir Starmer has the comfort of his trade deal with the US, other leaders are still scrambling to make progress ahead of Donald Trump’s 9 July deadline. That’s the date when high tariffs may be imposed, unless countries have reached agreements with the US. The Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez has been dragged into a spat with Trump, after he struck a deal with Nato to avoid raising Spain’s military spending to 5% of GDP, as other members have pledged. Trump is unhappy about this, declaring last night that he will make Spain “pay twice as much” in new tariffs. The US president said: We are negotiating with Spain on a trade deal and we will make them pay twice as much. I’m actually serious about that. “I like Spain. It’s a great place, and they’re great people, but Spain is the only country, out of all of the countries, that refuses to pay. They want a free ride but I am not going to let that happen.” Sanchez has hit back, calling Trump’s threat “doubly unfair,” as Spain actually runs a trade deficit with the US. He told reporters in Brussels: “Europe and the world have been suffering from a trade war, from tariff measures that we have considered — at least in Spain — from the first minute as unfair and also unilateral. In the case of Spain, they’re doubly unfair.” Keir Starmer was followed onto the stage at the QE2 centre by Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. As expected, Haviland urged ministers not to hit businesses with further tax rises for businesses in the next budget. She also added her voice to the debate on Rachel Reeves’s focus on fiscal rule forecasts, insisting that these fiscal rules need to be “responsive”. Haviland says: “There must be no further tax increases on business in the autumn budget. “Business leaders are resilient, but they are also flexible. “Some of our well thought-out business plans sometimes no longer meet our needs. When the facts change, so do we. “And the Government needs to take the same approach. “If the UK economy is subject to any further economic shock, such as a sustained spike in oil prices, then we need fiscal rules that are responsive and protect business investment.” Earlier this week the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, warned against “over-interpreting” the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts. If those forecasts were to move against the chancellor, she could feel pressure to raise taxes or cut spending to keep within her fiscal rules (which include having debt falling in five year’s time). As Bailey pointed out, “There is a danger in over-interpreting a five-year-ahead forecast.” The City watchdog is considering scrapping rules meant to protect struggling homeowners from having their homes repossessed, as prime minister Kier Starmer pushes regulators to remove red tape for businesses. The chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Nikhil Rathi, said the much-lauded mortgage charter, introduced just two years ago, was up for review as the body tries to address criticism for allegedly hampering economic growth. “The Chancellor sees the regulatory system as having regulated for risk, not growth. So we’re engaging seriously with this feedback, and we continue to make changes at pace,” Rathi told TheCityUK annual conference in London on Thursday morning. “Take mortgages – I have raised with the prime minister and the Chancellor the mortgage charter. It was designed for a period of sharply rising interest rates. But could it now be retired, with the [Consumer] Duty in place, repossessions lower, the maturing risk mindset? Do we need this duplicative approach, with the added reporting burdens it brings? So as we at the FCA review the mortgage market fundamentally, what signal does it send about political risk tolerance if the charter is retained?” Repealing the mortgage charter would mean that homeowners would no longer have access to a safety net that effectively gave them a a 12-month grace period before their home is repossessed. The charter means signatories have pledged the following: No home will be repossessed within 12 months of the first missed payment. Customers can seek advice from their lender without it affecting their credit score. Customers can switch to an interest-only deal for six months; or extend their mortgage term and revert back within six months if they want. Neither option requires an affordability check or will affect their credit score. Here’s a video clip of Keir Starmer telling businesses that their contribution has made a “huge difference”: Plus, here’s the PM talking about the opportunities for businsses from recent trade deals: Starmer is then asked how the government can help unlock and unleash technology and innnovation in the UK. He cites the government’s push to reform planning rules to make it quicker to get permission (citing a house in York that took 25 years to get built). And he also points to artificial intelligence, saying there are two stances: You can either be forward leaning, and see AI as a huge opportunity that’s going to transform our businesses, large and small. Or you can lean out and see it as a bit of a risk, be cautious, and put a lot of regulations around it. I’m a leaner-in, Starmer insists, adding “I think it’s going to be transformative.” He concludes by calling for “a true partnership” between government and business, saying: Business should run business. Government should partner business by creating the conditions which makes it easier for businesses to run their businesses. Q: Do you “fully get” the concerns that businesss have about the employment rights bill? Keir Starmer says he does, as businesses “don’t hold back” when they raise concerns. But he adds that many people recognize that a secure, protected workforce is good for business, and drives up productivity. Most of what is in the employment rights bill is done by good businesses, and is good practice anyway, he argues. Starmer pledges to keep working with businesses about the bill, but he doesn’t sound close to a u-turn. He insists that “I firmly believe that a well-respected, well-protected workforce is an essential ingredient” to creating economic growth and productivity. [Explainer: the bill introduces reforms such as banning zero-hours contracts, ending fire-and-rehire, and introducing “day one” protections from unfair dismissal. Polling suggests it could substantially increase Labour’s popularity with Reform and former Conservative voters. Critics, though, say the measures will cost businesses money and push up job losses] Keir Starmer then takes questions. Q: How concerned are you about the economic impact if there is a renewal of violence in the Middle East? Starmer points out there has been an immediate impact on oil prices (downwards) since the Israel-Iran ceasefire was agreed at the start of the week. He expains that one reason for his push for clean power, and renewable energy, is to achieve energy security. Starmer adds that he thinks we are “living in a period of global conflict….the like of which we haven’t seen in a very long time.” The world is more unstable, he adds. Starmer ends his speech by telling the British Chambers of Commerce’s annual conference that he is determined that Britain becomes “the global champion for free trade”, and promises to back British business. Starmer then toots his own trumpet (or possibly waves his own rattle) over the three trade deals the UK has arranged in recent months, with India, the United States and the EU. Starmer, a notable football nut, says this is his first hat trick since his children were seven years old, and he could still get the ball past them. So I’m going to take this particular hat trick. Starmer says the CEO of carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, Adrian Mardell, made it “crystal clear” that thousands of jobs across the West Midlands had been saved by the US trade deal, which brought down tariffs on UK car exports. The PM tells UK businesses that these deals are a “transformation” of the UK’s global brand, explaining: They said it wouldn’t be possible to get a US deal. It wouldn’t be possible to get an EU deal. If you had a US deal, you had to choose between the two. And it certainly wouldn’t be possible to get an India deal. But, we’ve been able to get them, and that is brilliant for Britain and brilliant for you. And we’ll go forward from here. Keir Starmer then tells UK businesses we need to “stop doing that British understatement thing”. He says he’s optimistic about creating the best possible conditions for UK businesses to succeed, while conceding that he knows “the trading environment is not easy”. Starmer insists he’s fighting for businesses, adding: But together, I do believe we’ve got to stop doing that British understatement thing. And we do it all the time, including me. Believe you me, this is a great moment to get on the phone to the world and say, take another look at Britain. Starmer adds that Jensen Huang, the CEO of chipmaking giant Nvidia, told him that “Britain is in a Goldilocks situation on AI”, and ready to take off. Starmer then tells the BCC conference that the spending review earlier this month is a “clear shift” towards investing in the future of the UK, not simply tackling the promises it inherited. Starmer says his administration have “wiped the slate clean”, stabilized the economy, and can now move onto building a fairer Britain, with change and renewal. Sir Keir Starmer, UK prime minister, has begun addressing the BCC’s Global Annual Conference 2025 at the QEII Conference Centre. Starmer (who was billed as ‘senior cabinet minister’ on the agenda) is back in London from the NATO summit in The Hague earlier this week. He tells top business chiefs that the British chambers of commerce which exist across the UK play an important role – in creating jobs, wealth, and tax receipts. Starmer then thanks UK businesses for the financial contribution they’ve made. Starmer says the government has been addressing an “unprecedented mess”, and has “asked a lot of you” (a nod to the tax rises in last autumn’s budget). Update: he says: ‘I fully acknowledge that this year, as we’ve had to fix the foundations of our country, [and] deal with the unprecedented mess that we inherited, we’ve asked a lot of you. I understand that, and I want to acknowledge that. It has made a huge difference. Because of it, Starmer says, money has gone into the NHS and brought waiting lists down, invested in the skills of young people, and into building new homes, roads, and infrastructure. They are all vital for the long-term growth of our country. But none of that would have been possible without your contribution. [nice words, but businesses didn’t choose to pay higher national insurance contributions, and – as flagged earlier – they are demanding no more tax rises] Here’s our news story on Shell doubling down on its denials that it is planning a bid for BP: A new report this morning warns that Britain faces a “bleak” outlook for living standards growth. The Resolution Foundation has calculated that typical disposable incomes, after housing costs, are on track to grow by just 1% over the second half of the decade. That would be a rise of just £300. Lower-income families are on course to fare even worse, with incomes projected to fall by 1 per cent over the second half of the decade. Pensioners are set to fare best of all, with their incomes forecast to rise by 5% (£1,500) over the period, while families with children are set for no income growth. A key factor, it seems, is housing. Those with a mortgage are on track to see their incomes fall by 1%, on average, as households whose fixed-rate deals end face higher costs. Those who own their property outright will avoid this mortgage bombshell, and see their incomes rise 3% on average. The Resolution Foundation point out that policy changes – such as ending the two-child limit – would lift average incomes. Adam Corlett, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, says: “The living standards story of the decade so far has been bust and boom, with Covid-19 and a cost of living crisis followed by a much-needed recovery last year. But the rest of the decade looks bleak, with typical household incomes set to grow by just 1 per cent over the next five years. “There are winners and losers within this weak outlook, with pensioner incomes set to grow by a healthy 5 per cent over the rest of the decade, while the poorest half of the population are set to see their incomes fall. “But a stronger economy and the right policy interventions can brighten this outlook. Maintaining strong wage growth and returning to pre-pandemic employment levels would make middle-income Britain far better off, while ending the two-child limit can lift living standards for poorer families.” There’s a calm feeling to trading in the City this morning, with the market slightly higher. The FTSE 100 index has risen by 6 points, or 0.07%, in early trading to 8725 points, led by gambling firm Entain (+2.3%) and mining company Anglo American (+1.8%). BP (+0.1%) and Shell (+0.17%) are both slightly higher. Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “Shell has denied media speculation of early talks to buy rival BP. Structurally lower oil prices are causing the majors to look at their options, but given Shell’s superior asset quality and balance sheet, any combination may be difficult for its shareholders to stomach. Cherry picking some flagship assets could be another option, but that’s unlikely to satisfy BP investors. For now, the focus for Shell is likely to remain on buying back its own shares.” 160 jobs are at risk at Associated British Foods’ Vivergo bioethanol plant in Hull, as the company begins consultations with staff at the same time as it holds negotiations with the government over the future of the site. It has blamed the UK-US trade deal - which would allow US ethanol into the UK tariff-free - for worsening the situation for the business. ABF - which also owns the Primark clothing chain and the parent of breadmaker Kingsmill – had earlier in the week extended its deadline for deciding the fate of the plant until today, in the hope that the government would come up with a support package. Bioethanol is a petrol substitute produced from agricultural products. Vivergo, along with Ensus - which is owned by Germany’s Sudzucker Group and operates a bioethanol plant in Teesside - are behind nearly all of the UK’s bioethanol production capacity. The plants and people working in their supply chains support thousands of jobs. An ABF spokesperson said it welcomed the government’s decision to launch formal negotiations with the company over the future of Vivergo. They added: “Over the coming weeks, we will engage intensively and transparently with officials to try to find a viable path forward. In parallel, we will today begin consultation with our employees. This process will conclude with a major decision to be made on the plant’s future, which will depend on whether the negotiations deliver a credible route forwards.” In the past few months, ABF has criticised the way the government applied regulations to imported ethanol and said this as “undermined” business. It said this situation had been “made significantly worse by the UK’s trade deal with the US”. Under the trade deal with the US, the current 19% tariffs on US ethanol will fall to zero, while the 1.4bn-litre quota represents the size of the UK’s entire current ethanol market. The removal of the tariff on bioethanol came as the US agreed to cut the 25% tariff rate on British steel aluminium exports as part of the trade deal, negotiations along with a lowering of the tariff on 100,000 British cars to 10%. ABF said it had been holding “extensive discussions” with the government. However, it told investors on Thursday that unless the government can “provide both short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses and a longer-term solution” it will close it down once consultations with staff end and it has fulfilled all its contractual obligations, and has not bought wheat since 11 June. The Hull Vivergo plant would close by 13 September. Sterling has hit its highest level in three and a half years against the dollar, following reports that Donald Trump could appoint a new US central bank early. The dollar has weakened, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was considering announcing his pick to succeed Jerome Powell – whose term expires next May – earlier than expected. Trump has been increasingly exasperated by Powell, as the Federal Reserve resisted his calls for lower interest rates. Announcing Powell’s successor early would put the focus on where the next Fed chief thought interest rates should be set. The WSJ reported: In recent weeks, the president has toyed with the idea of selecting and announcing Powell’s replacement by September or October, according to people familiar with the matter. One of these people said the president’s ire toward Powell could prompt an even-earlier announcement sometime this summer. Trump is considering former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, according to people familiar with the matter. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is being pitched to Trump by allies of both men as a potential candidate, some of these people said. Other contenders include former World Bank President David Malpass and Fed governor Christopher Waller. The dollar has dropped by 0.2% against a basket of currencies this morning, pushing the pound up to $1.37 for the first time since January 2022. Britain has focused too much on trying to sign major trade deals with other countries, ministers have said, as they lay out the case for a big shift in post-Brexit trade policy. The change forms the heart of the government’s new trade strategy, which ministers are publishing today. The strategy marks a turn away from the days of pursuing wide-ranging free trade agreements with countries such as the US and India, which were sold as one of the biggest prizes of Brexit. Instead, ministers say they now want to focus on more modest agreements such as deals to recognise foreign professional qualifications, which can help the UK’s services sector in particular… More here: Energy giant Shell has declared it has “no intention” of making an offer for rival BP, after takeover speculation swept the City last night. In a statement to the City, Shell insists it has not approached BP, and that no talks have taken place. It says: In response to recent media speculation Shell wishes to clarify that it has not been actively considering making an offer for BP and confirms it has not made an approach to, and no talks have taken place with, BP with regards to a possible offer. Under the takeover code, this means Shell can’t bid for BP for six months, unless it has the agreement of BP’s board, or if another company bids for BP, or if BP asks for a code waiver, or if there is a material change of circumstances. Shell explains: This is a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies and accordingly Shell confirms it has no intention of making an offer for BP. As a result Shell will be bound by the restrictions set out in Rule 2.8 of the Code. Last night, the Wall Street Journal reported that “early-stage talks” were taking place between Shell and BP to agree a historic £60bn takeover to create one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies. BP has been the subject of takeover speculation as investors have been unconvinced by its turnaround plan, pushing its value down over the last year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK businesses are urging the government to resist any temptation to impose further taxes on them, warning it would undermine Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves’s mission to grow the economy. Business leaders are gathering at the QEII Conference Centre in central London today, for the British Chambers of Commerce’s annual conference, where memories of last autumn’s budget tax hikes are still fresh. Shevaun Haviland, the BCC’s director general, will declare that if the government is serious about growth, then it cannot tax business any further. She’ll warn that businesses were taken by surprise by the size and scale of the rise in National Insurance Contributions in the last budget. Haviland is expected to say: “We were unprepared for the huge burden placed upon us, and it led many of us to rethink our growth plans. As a result, our business confidence measures have fallen to their lowest levels since 2022. For the government to achieve its Growth Mission, people need to stay in work and businesses need to invest. As always, businesses soak it up and move forward, but they feel like they are wading through treacle.” New research released by the BCC shows that the tax hike has hit hiring. It found that: One third of firms (32%) said they have either made staff redundant or are planning to as a direct result of the NICs increase. 13% say they have already made staff redundant and 19% say they are actively considering redundancies Business chiefs will also hear from Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative Party leader. The BCC’s intervention comes as the government struggles to keep within its fiscal rules, with forecasts it may need to raise taxes in the autumn. Ministers also face a significant rebellion the benefit cuts within its welfare bill. Abandoning the bill would blow a £5bn hole in Rachel Reeves’ budget. The government is also trying to woo businesses with a flurry of strategic plans. Earlier this week it unveiled its industrial strategy, and today it is presenting a trade strategy – which it says will protect vital UK industries and help businesses export.

They keep themselves anonymous, and perform with scarves and sunglasses hiding their faces. Fans are sent on digital breadcrumb trails via mysterious websites and social media posts. Their first interview, with the Face, was conducted in a chatroom of their own design, and scrubbed from the internet shortly after publication. Their second, with Mixmag, was done over email and paired with photos of a duo who fans on Reddit are almost certain are not actually Two Shell. So I am excited and wary when I arrive at their Deptford studio to talk with them about their self-titled debut album, released last week on the big-budget indie label Young. Two Shell’s music mashes together various kinds of dance music from the past few decades – speed garage, techno, hyperpop, house, dubstep – and runs it all through a cartoon filter, making for a sound that’s fast and dizzyingly heightened. Their studio is crammed with abstract paintings and pieces of outlandish raver gear. Two tables are covered with dozens of hats, each embellished with embroidery and scraps of fabric. Two young women are sitting on a fuzzy green couch, wearing outfits that sit somewhere between avant garde clubber and first-year art student: they introduce themselves as Flat Earther and Ghost Shrimp. “So, this is the interview,” I say. Ghost Shrimp cheerily replies: “OK!” I realise I haven’t phrased it right. “So, this is the interview?” The women respond, with a huge amount of pep: “Yes!” As well as their previous interview antics, the duo supposedly sent decoys to perform at their debut Boiler Room DJ set, and once performed four shows simultaneously at four different venues across London – though fans had worked out which show the “real” Two Shell would be at. They’ve played high-profile sets at Coachella and Glastonbury, presumably as themselves – although again, who knows? I ask Two Shell about their origins. They first became friends, Earther says, after Shrimp broke both her ankles, and the former had to wheel the latter around to their university lectures on an old office chair. They each speak with the blissed-out, slightly befuddled cadence of someone who’s just taken a gigantic hit on a gravity bong, and punctuate each other’s sentences with drawn out “yeeeeeahs”. They oscillate between generic, boilerplate statements about their work (“We’re really interested in collaboration, yeah?”) and genuinely engaging yarns. They weren’t born, for example: they popped out of a patch of Astroturf between Brixton and Loughborough Junction, and shortly afterwards performed their first ever set at a purgatory-like bus stop nearby, which they couldn’t leave until they became really great DJs. They compare themselves to vape flavours: Earther is more like Sadboy Blue while Shrimp feels aligned with Ego Death. Vape is important to Two Shell; it had a “ghostly presence”, along with a Lime scooter and a selfie stick, the day they “reverse slipped” out of that Astroturf. You see where this is going: the two women I spend a painful 45 minutes chatting to are almost definitely not Two Shell. I know this because if the duo really wanted to be anonymous, they could have done a much better job; less than five minutes of Googling nets me the names of two men. Childhood friends raised in south London, the pair have been making dance music for quite a few years under various names, although none of it has the brilliant alien thrill of the music they make as Two Shell. The decoy duo give me a mysterious-looking USB covered in grey putty, but when I plug it in it’s been corrupted. I initially assume this is yet another layer to the bit, but I have in fact become victim to my newfound Two Shell truther mentality: “It was not meant to be corrupt but not sure what was meant to be on there,” their manager texts me later. Two Shell’s publicist didn’t realise they had sent decoys, and when I run into him a couple of nights later, he says, with slight exasperation, that he really thought the duo were using this interview as an opportunity to give the jokes a rest for a second and just talk about their music. He then tells me that “Two Shell is actually 25 people” – alluding to the large network required to maintain things like shell.tech, the ever-changing password-protected site through which they release new music – before conceding that, yes, the music part likely is just two guys. After their album is released, it becomes clear that some advance versions sent out to the press to review were totally different from the finished thing; two editors at Pitchfork each received their own versions, and those versions were different to the one sent to the writer assigned to review the album. Two Shell have been releasing music for a good five years now – including a collaboration with FKA twigs, and a twisted rework of Sugababes’ Round Round endorsed by the group – and I am increasingly of the opinion that the prankster side of the duo might have played better during their post-pandemic breakout years, when the games and tricks heightened the anticipation and thrill of finally going out again. I head to the duo’s long-running ShellTek night at London’s Ormside Projects the day after my interview, courtesy of a token presented alongside my dud USB that would grant me entry every week, and am surprised to see that this release-week event is sparsely attended. A guy in the smokers’ area tells me that “ShellTek is always empty” before catching himself: “It’s meant to be empty – it’s a place for people to play their craziest, weirdest music.” You could charitably say that Two Shell’s pranks are a satire on rampant self-promotion in the age of social media, although they do present a conundrum: is a labyrinthine system of trick mirrors and trapdoors the absence of marketing, or lots and lots of it? Two Shell, the album, is a sadder, less sugary affair than previous releases – and emphatic confirmation that the music has and likely always will be the most engaging, exciting part of the project. Shrimp suggested to me that maybe the two things have to be linked: “We love pranks, but we don’t think they make it any less sincere,” she said. “When something’s funny, you can actually tell the truth, get to another level. It’s almost the most sincere.” • Two Shell is out now on Young. • This article was amended on 10 February 2025 to remove some personal information.", "section": "Music", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}

Luci, 60, lives just two miles from the Shell Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, a huge plant that “cracks” ethane, a byproduct of fracked gas, to make millions of tons of plastic each year. The plant, which became operational in 2022, sits on 386 acres along the Ohio River in Monaca, Pennsylvania. Initially, Luci was concerned about the project’s pollution in an area long plagued by emissions-heavy industry. But she looked forward to the needed jobs the plant would bring to a region that has seen many factories and mills shutter. In the following years, Luci’s optimism faded. Some days, she noticed dark plumes billowing from the cracker’s stacks. Other nights, the project would shoot flames or dye the sky orange. And every couple of months, a nauseating sweet odor wafted from the plant, like a syrup you would never want to eat. One morning this past summer, Luci and her neighbor were having a coffee outside when they were hit with “a huge and rancid chlorine smell” that burned her eyes and nose. Luci, who grew up in nearby Beaver, has suffered from respiratory illness since childhood and she fears pollution from the plant is exacerbating her symptoms. Since its construction began in 2017, the plant has received 33 violations for illegal levels of air and water pollution. “I don’t even want to drink my tap water,” said Luci, who fished in the Ohio River’s tributaries as a youth. The Ohio River supplies drinking water to more than 5 million people, including Luci’s town of Rochester. It is one of the most contaminated watersheds in the country. John Stolz, a microbiologist at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, said it was “definitely possible” that the Shell project had added to that contamination. Natalie Gunnell, spokesperson for the Shell plastic plant, said “the local water suppliers treat and monitor the drinking water.” Heather Hulton VanTassel, who directs the Three Rivers Waterkeeper organization in Pennsylvania, said Luci’s water should be cleaned by authorities, though bills may increase if they have to increase “pollutant removal”. For her part, Luci said she had noticed a “dead fish” smell occasionally coming from her tap water. Like many of her neighbors, she buys plastic water bottles in bulk. “We bitch about it, but we buy it, plastic, constantly,” she said from her kitchen. Critics say support for the plant was built on the company’s use of manipulative public relations tactics, and on reports that overstated the plant’s expected economic benefits while downplaying its potential environmental harms. “I think some of us went pretty quickly from hearing it’s going to increase jobs and home values and fix the economy … to learning it was going to be an environmental disaster,” said Rachel Meyer, a coordinator for the environmental group Moms Clean Air Force, from her dining room. Shell’s local influence campaign, critics say, came amid a broader, decades-long effort by fossil fuel companies to downplay the dangers of fossil fuels. Gunnell said that Shell had “made it a priority to work closely with communities near our operations to manage the social impacts of our activities and enhance the benefits we are able to bring”. Plastics boom for whom? In 2008, Pennsylvania began to experience a surge in fracking, giving fossil fuel producers access to once inaccessible gas. The boom left the area awash in petrochemicals including ethane, a common raw ingredient in plastics. Four years later, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers, looking to capitalize on this abundance, proposed offering Shell $1.6bn in tax incentives to build a new plastics plant – the largest subsidy package in Pennsylvania history. Citing Shell’s promise to create up to 20,000 jobs, they said the project would revitalize local economies. Two Shell-funded studies would later back up that claim: a 2014 report estimated the plant would contribute up to $4.4bn to the local economy over its 40-year operating lifespan, and a 2021 follow-up report placed that estimate at up to $17bn. But in January, independent analysts with the Ohio River Valley Institute found that the studies were too rosy, due to their failure to consider costs to the public or shifts in the market and regulatory environment. Though nearly 8,600 workers did provide a surge of economic activity to Beaver county during the plant’s construction, many hailed from out of state. Today, the cracker plant only employs about 500 full-time workers, according to Shell. “They say they’re creating hundreds of jobs, but that’s a drop in the damn bucket,” said Luci. Officials said the plant would anchor a vast petrochemical hub, employing tens of thousands, but that hub never materialized. Gunnell said: “We are proud of the jobs, economic benefits and social investment dollars and projects we have brought to the region and will continue to bring to the regional economy for decades to come.” Pollution When the new plant began operations in November 2022, Shell touted a “strong and innovative safety focus”. But the Shell plant emits a wide range of pollutants, including volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and other toxins that have been linked to illnesses ranging from respiratory disease to cancer. The project has received two dozen violations for air pollution and eight for water contamination, with the first issued just months after construction began in 2017, and the most recent issued in September. “Meeting or exceeding regulatory requirements is part of our operating framework,” Gunnell said. “If we fall short, we aim to understand why and implement new ways of working that are clear and actionable.” Shell reports emissions to regulators and publishes “fenceline monitoring results” from the facility’s property line, Gunnell noted. Advocates say the latter came only after years of pressure. Residents have also accused officials of failing to address locals’ concerns. In April 2023, as neighbors said that the air smelled like kerosene, monitors placed by a local grassroots organization detected levels of benzene that exceeded federal standards. But when the Pennsylvania environment department came out to investigate, they relied only on a human “sniff test” and downplayed concerns, advocates said. “Visiting the Shell plant and merely smelling the air is inadequate to assess whether there are any air permit violations or malfunctions, let alone whether it’s safe to breathe the air,” said Alex Bomstein, executive director of the environmental non-profit the Clean Air Council. Benzene, the main pollutant of concern during the incident, can be smelled in concentrations of 12 parts per million, but federal officials say exposure to concentrations of just 0.01 parts per million require workers to wear protective equipment, he noted. Lauren Camarda, the Pennsylvania environment department spokesperson, said the agency was “committed to ensuring that the Shell facility is operating in accordance with Pennsylvania’s laws and regulations and has held them accountable for violations”, Since fall 2023, the Shell plant’s emissions have been on a “constant downward trend”, she said. The Clean Air Council and other green groups have taken legal action against Shell over this incident and others. Those organizations are also pressuring the state to tighten the plant’s water pollution limits. In May 2023, the company agreed to a $10m settlement with the state for air pollution violations. The plant had then only been operational for about six months, but had already surpassed its 12-month emissions limits on volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and other pollutants. This agreement addressed “previous emissions exceedances”, Gunnell said. Shell was required to report the facility’s emissions to authorities monthly as part of the settlement, Camarda said. A local resident this February also launched litigation claiming the plant is both a private and public nuisance and seeking class-action status. And in a Washington county courthouse in early December, Shell was convicted of criminal charges after pleading no contest to three misdemeanor counts brought by the Pennsylvania attorney general, for violating the state’s clean streams law during the construction of the Falcon pipeline, which feeds gas to the cracker plant. “Shell is aware of two lawsuits pending in the western district of Pennsylvania relating to Shell Polymers Monaca, which remain in active litigation,” Gunnell said, adding that Shell’s positions on and responses to the allegations were public record. At peak capacity, the project will require ethane to be extracted from 1,000 new gas wells every five to 10 years, experts say, creating additional pollution. ‘You can’t avoid influence’ Before construction on the plant began, Shell’s plastics division began providing equipment to local schools and sponsoring scholarships – public relations tactics that have recently come under increasing scrutiny. It even spent $1m to create a new technology program – which sports the Shell name – at one community college. The company has also donated handsomely to the local Salvation Army, the YMCA, and other non-profits, and has paid for local park benches and a new basketball court at one elementary school. Gunnell, the Shell spokesperson, said: “We have enjoyed the support of the local community and are committed to being a good neighbor. “The bulk of our Shell Polymers employees live, work and play here, so we want to help make our community better whenever we can,” she added. But Vanessa Lynch, a local organizer with Moms Clean Air Force, said many residents find their community contributions confusing. “You have a company that is a huge corporation, and they’re telling you: we want to help the community,” she said. “But then, as a community member, you’re watching the increase in fracking. You’re watching a red sky at night. You’re smelling smells …It’s hard to have those two things in your head at the same time.” Local activists say even the payout from the 2023 lawsuit – half of which has been allocated for air monitoring, environmental projects and other initiatives – has been confused for altruism. “I’ve heard residents and even county employees mention it like it’s a charity,” said Andie Grey, an activist who lives three miles from the plant. Shell’s donations may serve to damp down criticism and influence public opinion, said Terrie Baumgardner, a board member of the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community. “It seems to me that you can’t avoid influence when money comes into play,” she said. Years before the plant started operating, Baumgardner said she asked an assistant at a local university, where she had worked for 26 years, to use a room for a local environmental group to hold a public meeting. “Well, you know, Terrie, we have partnerships with Shell,” she remembers being told. Her request was rejected. Timmons Roberts, professor of environment and sociology at Brown University, who studies fossil fuel companies’ public relations campaigns, said it was common for polluting sectors to partner with community groups to boost their image. “That’s true on the smaller scale when local people are worried about new industries, and it’s true on the big scale to soothe concerns about climate,” he said. “It seems like a favor … but I think mostly it’s meant to shut people up.” Impacts beyond Pennsylvania The Shell plant is expected to reach its full production capacity in 2025 or 2026, when the company says it will produce up to 3.5bn tons of plastic pellets a year. Permits allow the plant to spew out 2.25m tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide annually – the equivalent of putting 523,604 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles on the road. Plastic creation accounts for 5% of all global carbon emissions, and absent decisive policy changes, that figure is expected to rise. In early December, the latest round of negotiations to reach a global treaty on plastic pollution collapsed amid accusations that industry involvement hampered the negotiations. Reports indicate that Shell has been aware since the 1970s of the planet-warming impacts of fossil fuels like the ones used to produce plastic. It has set targets to ramp down its carbon emissions but this year watered them down. Asked for comment, Gunnell said: “The Shell Group did not have unique knowledge about climate change. “The issue of climate change and how to tackle it has long been part of public discussion and ongoing scientific research for many decades,” she said. Asked about the planet-heating impacts of using fossil fuels to make plastics, Gunnell said that Shell “supports the need for improved circularity in the global plastics markets, encouraging the reduction, reuse, and recycling of plastics”. She added that Shell was supporting local recycling efforts, including in Beaver county. But globally less than 10% of plastics are ever recycled. Plastic producers – including Shell – were warned decades ago that recycling is not an economically or technically feasible plastic waste management solution, a February report revealed. In July, Shell also quietly backed away from a pledge to rapidly increase its use of “advanced recycling” – a polluting practice oil and petrochemical producers have promoted as a solution to the plastics pollution crisis, the Guardian reported. Gunnell did not comment on either finding. Meyer, of Moms Clean Air Force, feels that her region was “sacrificed” for the sake of profits. “I don’t like to think of myself as just as expendable [as a] plastic bag,” she said. But it now seems that even Shell’s profit targets are not panning out. The company has already acknowledged that it won’t meet its initial target – making $1bn to $1.5bn in earnings from the plant – until 2025 at the earliest. And in October, the thinktank the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that it may not even reach that goal by the end of 2026, thanks to expected increases in the cost of gas and shifting market dynamics. “All this sacrifice has been pretty much for nothing,” said Abhishek Sinha, who led the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis research. As she has continued to see the Shell plastic plant spew pollution into her community, Nadine Luci has thought about moving away. It’s painful to think of leaving her local family members and her childhood memories, but she’s afraid her body can’t handle the pollution. “It feels wrong because all my roots are here,” she said. “I’ve been here all this time, and now I have to be the one to figure out how to escape.” Reporting for this story was made possible through a Climate Disinformation Fellowship from the Heinrich Boell Foundation, Washington", "section": "US news", "query": "Shell", "companies": ["Shell"]}
